# NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10)

Instructions to install FastVideo on an **NVIDIA DGX Spark** — the GB10
Grace-Blackwell platform.

The Spark is **ARM64 (`aarch64`) with CUDA 13**, which the standard
[NVIDIA GPU guide](gpu.md) does not cover: there is no prebuilt `aarch64` wheel
for `fastvideo-kernel`, so it is **compiled from source** as part of the
install, and the system Python typically lacks the development headers that
build needs. The steps below handle both, **without requiring `sudo`**.

## Requirements

- **OS: Linux (`aarch64`)**
- **GPU: NVIDIA GB10** (compute capability `sm_121`), at least 1
- **CUDA Toolkit: 13.x** at `/usr/local/cuda` (`nvcc` on `PATH`)
- **Python: 3.10–3.12**
- **Compilers:** gcc/g++ 10+ (the Spark ships gcc 13)

!!! note "Different compute capability?"
    These instructions target the GB10's `sm_121`. The kernel build auto-detects
    it from your GPU, so there is normally nothing to set. To check your device:
    ```bash
    python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_capability(0))"  # GB10 -> (12, 1)
    ```

## Install

Run from the repository root:

```bash
# 0. (once) install uv and put it on PATH
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
git clone https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.git && cd FastVideo

# 1. Create a venv on a uv-managed CPython 3.12 (bundles the dev headers the
#    kernel build needs; the Spark's system python3.12 lacks them).
uv venv .venv --python 3.12 --python-preference only-managed --seed
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Initialise the kernel submodules (cutlass + ThunderKittens headers).
git submodule update --init --recursive \
  fastvideo-kernel/include/cutlass fastvideo-kernel/include/tk

# 3. Install FastVideo (editable; compiles the in-tree kernel for the GB10).
UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install -e .
```

Contributors who want the lint/test tooling:
`UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

Then jump to [Verify the install](#verify-the-install).

## Building without a visible GPU (CI / Docker)

With no GPU visible the kernel build can't probe the arch and `auto` can't detect
the driver — name both explicitly:

```bash
UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1 uv pip install -e .
```

## Verify the install

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torch, fastvideo
print("fastvideo:", fastvideo.__version__)
print("torch    :", torch.__version__, "| cuda:", torch.version.cuda, "| avail:", torch.cuda.is_available())
print("device   :", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
PY

fastvideo --help
```

Expected: a `+cu130` torch, `device: NVIDIA GB10`, and the CLI listing
`generate / serve / router-serve / bench / eval`.

To confirm the **compiled** CUDA kernel actually runs on the GB10 (importing
alone doesn't execute the `.so`):

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import torch
from fastvideo_kernel import Int8Linear
lin  = torch.nn.Linear(512, 256, bias=False).cuda().to(torch.bfloat16)
# .cuda() is required: from_linear() leaves the int8 buffers on the CPU
qlin = Int8Linear.from_linear(lin, quantize=True).cuda()  # compiled quant_cuda
x    = torch.randn(128, 512, device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
y, ref = qlin(x), lin(x)                                  # compiled gemm_cuda
rel = (y.float() - ref.float()).norm() / ref.float().norm()
print(f"int8 GEMM rel err vs fp32: {rel.item():.4f}  (~0.01 is correct; int8 is lossy)")
PY
```

## Manual build (advanced / fallback)

The one-liner above is the supported path. Build the kernel yourself only if you
are iterating on the CUDA source or the auto-build fails:

```bash
# install torch + the kernel's build deps into the active venv first
UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio scikit-build-core cmake ninja setuptools wheel
# build just the kernel against that torch (auto-detects sm_121)
uv pip install ./fastvideo-kernel --no-build-isolation
# then the rest of FastVideo
uv pip install -e .
```

Or `cd fastvideo-kernel && ./build.sh`, which auto-detects the arch and does the
same compile (it initializes only the kernel's `cutlass` and `tk` submodules).

## Optional: flash-attn

Not installed by default. FastVideo falls back to other attention backends
without it. For the guide's Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.12, and CUDA 13 environment,
install the matching prebuilt Linux ARM64 wheel from the
[FlashAttention prebuilt wheel index](https://mjunya.com/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/?python=3.12&torch=2.12&cuda=13.0&platform=Linux+arm64):

```bash
uv pip install "https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/releases/download/v0.9.22/flash_attn-2.8.3%2Bcu130torch2.12-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl"
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| `Could NOT find Python (missing: ... Development.Module)` | venv built from system Python without headers. Recreate with `--python-preference only-managed` (add `--clear` to reuse the path), or `sudo apt install python3.12-dev`. |
| kernel build can't find cutlass headers | Submodules not initialised — run the `git submodule update` step. |
| `fastvideo-kernel: could not determine the target CUDA architecture` | The build couldn't see a GPU and no arch was given. Build on the Spark itself, or pass `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1` (see [Building without a visible GPU](#building-without-a-visible-gpu-ci--docker)). |
| `nvcc fatal: Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_121'` | `nvcc` older than CUDA 12.9/13. Confirm `nvcc --version` is 13.x and `CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc`. |
| `ninja: command not found` (manual build only) | `uv pip install scikit-build-core cmake ninja setuptools wheel`. |

## Next: performance & tuning

Installed and verified? See [DGX Spark: Performance & Tuning](spark_performance.md)
for which models are practical on the GB10, what makes them faster, and what
won't help on this hardware (and why) — so you don't spend a night tuning knobs
that can't move here.

Two Sparks with QSFP cables: [Pair two NVIDIA DGX Sparks](spark_pair.md) for
one FastH3 clip across both GPUs (`sp_size=2` over Ray). Copy-paste commands
for one or two Sparks also live on the
[MiniMax H3 cookbook](../../cookbook/minimax-h3.md): pick FastH3 Preview,
then NVIDIA DGX Spark, then 1 Spark or 2 Sparks.
