# Porting Eval Metrics into `fastvideo.eval`

This guide is for contributors adding new evaluation metrics to
FastVideo's eval suite. To run the existing metrics, see
[`fastvideo/eval/README.md`](https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo/blob/main/fastvideo/eval/README.md).

## When to use this guide

Use this guide when you are:

- Adding a new metric (native or wrapping a third-party library).
- Porting a benchmark (e.g. VBench, MIND, EvalCrafter) whose Python
  code needs to be importable from a pinned upstream.
- Adding a new metric group (audio, videoscore2, etc.).

## TL;DR

Metrics are auto-discovered from
`fastvideo/eval/metrics/<group>/<name>/metric.py`. Each declares itself
with `@register("<group>.<name>")` and subclasses `BaseMetric`. Five
recipes, depending on how the metric ships and what its licence allows:

1. **Native metric** (pure-PyTorch, no submodule). Drop a file,
   declare deps, implement `compute(sample)`.
2. **Library-wrapped metric** (CLIP, torch.hub, transformers, pyiqa).
   Same as above, plus route the library's cache through
   `get_cache_dir()` if it has a `download_root=` / `cache_dir=`
   kwarg.
3. **Submodule-wrapped metric** (vbench-style). Pin upstream as a git
   submodule under `fastvideo/third_party/eval/<bench>/`. The adapter
   `__init__.py` does the `sys.path` insert and any runtime compat
   shims. Best for large research packages with stable layouts.
4. **Vendored upstream** (synchformer / glmasr-style). Copy a small,
   surgical piece of upstream into `fastvideo/third_party/eval/<name>/`
   with its `LICENSE` alongside. Best for permissive-licensed
   (MIT / Apache-2.0) source you need a few files from.
5. **Git-source dep via `[tool.uv.sources]`** (ImageBind-style). For
   license-restricted upstream (e.g. CC BY-NC-SA) that cannot be
   redistributed in the FastVideo tree. uv pulls the source at install
   time pinned to a SHA in `pyproject.toml`.

The full recipes are below.

## 0) Layout and auto-discovery

```
fastvideo/eval/metrics/
├── base.py                  # BaseMetric + lifecycle contract
├── common/                  # group: SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS
├── optical_flow/            # group: gt_optical_flow, synthetic_optical_flow
├── audio/                   # group: CLAP, AudioBox, KL, FAD, WER, DeSync, ImageBind
├── videoscore2/             # VideoScore-2 (single metric at group level)
├── physics_iq/              # group + sub-metrics
└── vbench/                  # group: 16 sub-metrics
    ├── __init__.py          # sys.path bootstrap + runtime compat shims
    ├── _grit_helper.py      # shared upstream-touching helpers
    └── <sub_metric>/metric.py
```

Auto-discovery (`fastvideo/eval/metrics/__init__.py`) walks each group
dir and imports every `metric.py` it finds, which fires the
`@register` decorators. Names starting with `_` are skipped. Use that
prefix for shared helpers or vendored code that should not register
itself.

---

## 1) The `BaseMetric` contract

Every metric subclasses `fastvideo.eval.metrics.base.BaseMetric` and
declares:

```python
class YourMetric(BaseMetric):
    name: str = "common.your_metric"          # must match @register
    requires_reference: bool = True           # needs sample["reference"]
    higher_is_better: bool = True             # for ranking / aggregates
    dependencies: list[str] = []              # importable module names;
                                              # registry surfaces a clean
                                              # ImportError if missing
    needs_gpu: bool = False
    backbone: str | None = None               # e.g. "clip_vit_l14"
```

You must implement:

```python
def compute(self, sample: dict) -> list[MetricResult]:
    """sample['video'] is (1, T, C, H, W). Return a one-element list.

    The leading 1 is preserved for forward-compat with batched eval;
    today :class:`EvalWorker` always invokes metrics with B=1.
    """
```

You may override:

- `setup(self) -> None`. Eager model loading. Called once by
  `create_evaluator`. Idempotent (re-entrant). Use the `if self._model
  is not None: return` pattern.
- `to(self, device)`. Move the metric and its submodels to `device`.

If a required input is missing (e.g. an fps-aware metric called
without `fps`), return `self._skip(sample, reason)` instead of
raising.

---

## 2) Recipe A: native metric (no external deps)

Smallest case. Pixel math, simple closed-form.

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/common/your_metric/metric.py
from __future__ import annotations
import torch
from fastvideo.eval.metrics.base import BaseMetric
from fastvideo.eval.registry import register
from fastvideo.eval.types import MetricResult


@register("common.your_metric")
class YourMetric(BaseMetric):
    name = "common.your_metric"
    requires_reference = True
    higher_is_better = True
    needs_gpu = False
    dependencies: list[str] = []  # nothing extra

    def compute(self, sample: dict) -> list[MetricResult]:
        gen, ref = sample["video"], sample["reference"]   # (B,T,C,H,W) each
        per_video = ((gen - ref) ** 2).mean(dim=(1, 2, 3, 4)).sqrt()
        return [
            MetricResult(name=self.name, score=float(s), details={})
            for s in per_video
        ]
```

That is the whole recipe. Drop the file and the registry picks it up.

---

## 3) Recipe B: library-wrapped metric (CLIP, torch.hub, transformers, pyiqa)

If your metric loads a backbone from a Python package, route the
library at the eval cache so users get one knob (`FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE`)
to redirect everything.

### Cache routing rules

| Library | How to route | Location after redirect |
|---|---|---|
| `clip.load("ViT-X")` | pass `download_root=str(get_cache_dir() / "clip")` | `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/clip/` |
| `torch.hub.load(...)` | nothing; `TORCH_HOME` is redirected at `fastvideo.eval` import time | `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/torch/hub/` |
| `transformers.from_pretrained(...)` | nothing; leave HF's default cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`) so users dedupe with other ML projects | `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` |
| `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` / `hf_hub_download` | use `ensure_checkpoint(...)` (it wraps these with filelock) | same as above |
| `pyiqa.create_metric(...)` | no env var or kwarg honored; document in metric docstring | pyiqa-internal |
| `lpips`, `ptlflow` | torch.hub-based, auto-redirected | `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/torch/hub/` |
| Raw URL (no HF Hub) | use `ensure_checkpoint(name, source="https://...")` | `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/models/<name>` |
| Dataset asset (raw video/mask/image) auto-fetched from a public bucket | download into `get_cache_dir() / "datasets" / "<bench>"`, mirroring upstream's relative layout. Vendor any small manifest (CSV/JSON ≤1 MB) under the metric folder so the dataset can be used without external setup. | `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/datasets/<bench>/` |

### Dataset assets: vendor the manifest, auto-fetch the rest

If your metric ships with its own paired-reference dataset (Physics-IQ
is the canonical example), follow this layout:

- **Manifest** (CSV/JSON ≤1 MB): vendor it under
  `fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/_vendored/<manifest>.<ext>`, with a
  sibling `_vendored/LICENSE` recording attribution and provenance.
  The `_vendored/` subdir is the project-wide convention for
  upstream-provenance files: it is auto-skipped by metric discovery
  (the `_` prefix) and by codespell (one `*/_vendored/*` glob in
  `[tool.codespell].skip`), so dropping in a new vendored file
  requires no further config. Read the manifest from the dataset
  module via a `Path(__file__)`-relative resolver. Mirror
  `_VENDORED_DESCRIPTIONS_CSV` in
  `fastvideo/eval/datasets/physics_iq.py`.
- **Heavy assets** (videos, masks, images): do not vendor. Auto-fetch
  on first miss into `get_cache_dir() / "datasets" / "<bench>"`,
  mirroring upstream's relative directory layout one-for-one so a
  pre-downloaded mirror at any path works as a drop-in
  `dataset_root=`. Use atomic `.part` then final-rename to be safe
  under concurrent SLURM ranks.
- **Bucket override**: expose `FASTVIDEO_<BENCH>_BUCKET_URL` so users
  with internal mirrors can redirect.
- **Opt-out**: accept `auto_download: bool = True` in the dataset
  constructor; on `False`, raise `FileNotFoundError` instead of
  fetching. This covers air-gapped runs and CI.

The end-state is `get_dataset("<bench>")` with no kwargs.

### Example: CLIP backbone + LAION head

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/your_group/your_metric/metric.py
from __future__ import annotations
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from fastvideo.eval.metrics.base import BaseMetric
from fastvideo.eval.registry import register
from fastvideo.eval.types import MetricResult


@register("your_group.your_metric")
class YourMetric(BaseMetric):
    name = "your_group.your_metric"
    requires_reference = False
    needs_gpu = True
    dependencies = ["clip"]      # "openai-clip" PyPI; importable as `clip`

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self._clip = None
        self._head = None

    def setup(self) -> None:
        if self._clip is not None:
            return
        import clip
        from fastvideo.eval.models import ensure_checkpoint, get_cache_dir

        # Backbone: route CLIP's cache through our root.
        self._clip, _ = clip.load(
            "ViT-L/14",
            device=self.device,
            download_root=str(get_cache_dir() / "clip"),
        )
        self._clip.eval()

        # URL-fetched head: ensure_checkpoint downloads to
        # ${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/models/ with filelock + atomic rename.
        ckpt = ensure_checkpoint(
            "your_head.pth",
            source="https://example.com/path/to/your_head.pth",
        )
        self._head = nn.Linear(768, 1)
        self._head.load_state_dict(
            torch.load(ckpt, map_location="cpu", weights_only=True)
        )
        self._head.to(self.device).eval()

    def to(self, device):
        super().to(device)
        if self._clip is not None:
            self._clip = self._clip.to(self.device)
        if self._head is not None:
            self._head = self._head.to(self.device)
        return self

    def compute(self, sample: dict) -> list[MetricResult]:
        ...
```

### Do not redirect other `~/.cache/...` dirs

If a third-party library hard-codes `~/.cache/<lib>/` and offers no
override, document the exception in the metric's docstring. Forcing
redirection by setting `os.environ` or patching `os.path.expanduser`
is fragile and breaks user expectations of where the library's cache
lives.

---

## 4) Recipe C: upstream-submodule-wrapped metric (vbench pattern)

Use this when the upstream benchmark ships Python code (`vbench/`,
`MIND/`, etc.) that is not pip-installable cleanly. See
`fastvideo/eval/metrics/vbench/__init__.py` for the worked example.

### 4.1 Pin the upstream as a submodule

```bash
git submodule add <upstream-url> fastvideo/third_party/eval/<bench>
cd fastvideo/third_party/eval/<bench>
git checkout <pinned-sha>
cd -
git add .gitmodules fastvideo/third_party/eval/<bench>
```

The submodule pulls under the standard `git submodule update --init
--recursive` flow that users already run for kernel deps.

### 4.2 Bootstrap on `sys.path`

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/__init__.py
from __future__ import annotations
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/__init__.py → ../../../../third_party/eval/<bench>
_UPSTREAM = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3] / "third_party" / "eval" / "<bench>"
if _UPSTREAM.is_dir() and str(_UPSTREAM) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(_UPSTREAM))
```

We do not `pip install` the upstream because its egg-link/.pth would
just re-do this `sys.path.insert`, and skipping the install also skips
the upstream's `setup.py` (which often gates on a specific CUDA
version).

### 4.3 Modern-dep compat: runtime shims

Upstream code pinned to e.g. `transformers==4.33.2`, `numpy<2`
typically breaks against modern versions in 3-4 known places (API
renames). Fix those at import time, in the same `__init__.py`:

```python
def _install_compat_shims() -> None:
    # Example: transformers.modeling_utils API moved.
    try:
        import transformers.modeling_utils as _mu
        import transformers.pytorch_utils as _pu
        for _n in ("apply_chunking_to_forward",
                   "find_pruneable_heads_and_indices",
                   "prune_linear_layer"):
            if not hasattr(_mu, _n) and hasattr(_pu, _n):
                setattr(_mu, _n, getattr(_pu, _n))
    except ImportError:
        pass

    # Example: numpy.lib.function_base.disp removed in numpy>=2.
    try:
        import types, numpy.lib as _nl
        if not hasattr(_nl, "function_base"):
            _stub = types.ModuleType("numpy.lib.function_base")
            _stub.disp = lambda *a, **k: None
            sys.modules["numpy.lib.function_base"] = _stub
            _nl.function_base = _stub
    except ImportError:
        pass

_install_compat_shims()
```

For function-level patches that cannot be expressed as attribute
writes (e.g. wrapping a model factory function), use a
`sys.meta_path` finder that wraps the loader. See
`_install_modeling_finetune_hook()` in
`fastvideo/eval/metrics/vbench/__init__.py` for the pattern (about 30
lines).

Why shims rather than `git apply` patches: patches go stale when the
upstream SHA changes; shims are versioned Python code in our repo,
they are grep-able, and they only run if the targeted module is
imported.

### 4.4 Per-sub-metric files

Each sub-metric is a normal `BaseMetric` subclass that imports from
the upstream:

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/<sub>/metric.py
from fastvideo.eval.metrics.base import BaseMetric
from fastvideo.eval.registry import register
from fastvideo.eval.types import MetricResult


@register("<bench>.<sub>")
class YourSubMetric(BaseMetric):
    ...

    def setup(self) -> None:
        if self._model is not None:
            return
        # The sys.path bootstrap fired when fastvideo.eval.metrics.<bench>
        # was imported (which auto-discovery does before importing this
        # sub-package). Upstream imports just work:
        from <bench>.something import SomeModel
        ...
```

### 4.5 Conditional registration when the upstream is missing

If a user installed `fastvideo[eval]` but did not run `git submodule
update --init`, `<bench>.*` metrics should not register. The
auto-discovery walker imports each sub-package's `metric` module; have
that import bail out cleanly:

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/__init__.py — at the bottom
_AVAILABLE = (_UPSTREAM / "<bench>" / "__init__.py").is_file()
```

```python
# fastvideo/eval/metrics/<bench>/<sub>/__init__.py
from fastvideo.eval.metrics.<bench> import _AVAILABLE
if _AVAILABLE:
    from .metric import YourSubMetric  # noqa
```

`fastvideo eval list` then reflects what the user actually has rather
than what they could have.

### 4.6 Leave the upstream alone unless it blocks the metric

The upstream is pinned. If a metric works against the pinned SHA,
leave the upstream files untouched. If it actively breaks against
modern deps (the import-drift cases above), shim it. Avoid
fastvideo-side forks of upstream code; they make patches go stale and
parity drift.

---

## 5) Model checkpoints: `ensure_checkpoint`

Use `ensure_checkpoint(name, source, filename=None)` for any
non-package weights. It resolves a local path, downloading on miss,
with filelock safety across processes and SLURM ranks.

| `source` form | What happens |
|---|---|
| `"/abs/path/to/file.pth"` | passthrough, returned unchanged |
| `"https://..."` | downloaded to `${FASTVIDEO_EVAL_CACHE}/models/<name>` via `huggingface_hub.http_get`, atomic rename, filelock |
| `"org/repo"` (no `filename`) | `snapshot_download(repo_id)` → `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` |
| `"org/repo"` (with `filename`) | `hf_hub_download(repo_id, filename)` → `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` |

`name` is only used as the local filename for URL sources. HF sources
ignore it (HF manages its own cache key by content hash).

```python
from fastvideo.eval.models import ensure_checkpoint

# URL: name matters
ckpt = ensure_checkpoint(
    "amt-s.pth",
    source="https://huggingface.co/lalala125/AMT/resolve/main/amt-s.pth",
)

# HF single file: name is decorative
ckpt = ensure_checkpoint(
    "raft-things.pth",                      # ignored; HF cache uses repo+sha
    source="OpenGVLab/VBench_Used_Models",
    filename="raft-things.pth",
)
```

---

## 6) Declaring `dependencies`

Set `dependencies = ["pkg1", "pkg2"]` on your metric class with
importable module names (not PyPI distribution names). The registry
checks each via `importlib.util.find_spec` at instantiation time and
raises a clean `ImportError` pointing the user at the right install
extra:

```python
class YourMetric(BaseMetric):
    dependencies = ["clip", "timm"]   # importable as `import clip`, `import timm`
```

If a dep is in `[project.optional-dependencies.eval-<group>]`, you do
not need to do anything more. If it is a new dep, add it to that
group in `pyproject.toml`.

---

## 7) Common gotchas

- The standard `git submodule update --init --recursive` is enough
  for a benchmark; do not write a `setup.sh`. Modern-dep compat goes
  into your `__init__.py` as runtime shims.
- Do not modify upstream files on disk. The submodule should always
  match its pinned SHA. Compat lives in our `__init__.py`.
- Do not pip-install the upstream. The egg-link is a glorified
  `sys.path.insert`, which we do directly in `__init__.py`.
- Do not call `torch.hub.set_dir(...)` from your metric. It is done
  globally in `fastvideo/eval/__init__.py`.
- Do not put cache-redirection env vars in your metric's `setup()`.
  By the time `setup()` runs, the library has likely already cached
  the default-location decision. Set env vars at package-init time.
- Skip rather than raise when an input is missing. Use
  `self._skip(sample, reason)` for any expected-missing input. It
  returns a list of `MetricResult(score=None)` so other metrics in
  the same evaluator continue.
- Watch for upstream re-registration conflicts. If the upstream uses
  a global registry (detectron2's `META_ARCH_REGISTRY`, MMCV, etc.),
  loading the same model twice in the same process will throw. The
  evaluator already loads each metric once; if you write a custom
  setup-then-call pattern, mirror that single-load discipline.

---

## 8) Training-time eval: keep evaluators hot, free caches between calls

When wiring eval into a training loop, the working pattern is:

1. Construct the `Evaluator` once and attach it to the pipeline
   (`self._eval = create_evaluator(...)`). Do not recreate it per
   validation round; that re-pays the model load cost.
2. Save validation videos to disk (the diffusion path already does
   this). Pass paths to `evaluator.evaluate`, not in-memory tensors
   that share GPU memory with the training model.
3. Run validation only on rank 0 of each sequence-parallel group.
   Gather paths from other ranks and let rank 0 score everything.
4. After every `evaluate(...)` call, call
   `evaluator.release_cuda_memory()` in a `finally` block. That runs
   `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` +
   `torch.cuda.ipc_collect()`. The eval model stays loaded; only
   transient activation buffers from the just-finished call get
   freed:

   ```python
   for video_path in batch:
       try:
           scores = self._eval.evaluate(video=load_video(video_path))
       finally:
           self._eval.release_cuda_memory()
   ```

5. If memory pressure spikes (rare on H200), call
   `evaluator.unload()` to drop every metric reference and let the
   GPU memory be GC'd. `unload` is reversible:
   `evaluator.reload()` rebuilds the same metrics with the original
   config (re-paying the model load cost). Calling `evaluate`
   between `unload` and `reload` raises a clear `RuntimeError`.

For most metrics (sub-1 GB backbones, e.g. CLIP/DINO/RAFT/AMT) the
eval model can stay co-resident with the training model in
`transformer.eval()` mode without any swap. For larger ones
(VideoScore2 at 14 GB), measure first; if it fits on the rank-0 GPU
during validation (training model in eval mode means no
grads/optimizer updates), keep it hot. If not, `unload` between
rounds.

## 9) Local verification

Native and library-wrapped metrics: a single-GPU smoke is enough.

```python
import torch
from fastvideo.eval import create_evaluator

ev = create_evaluator(metrics=["<group>.<your_metric>"], device="cuda")
video = torch.randn(1, 49, 3, 256, 256, device="cuda").clamp(0, 1)
print(ev.evaluate(video=video))
```

Submodule-wrapped metrics: also do a parity check against the
upstream once. Clone upstream into a separate venv, run the same
video through both, and expect an exact match on bit-deterministic
metrics and ≤1% drift on backbone-heavy ones (driven by
transformers/torch version differences).

For quick parity in CI: pin a tiny test video, record expected
scores ± tolerance, and add a calibration test under
`fastvideo/tests/eval/`.

---

## 10) When not to add a metric

- **Metrics requiring a single-GPU model larger than available
  memory.** Eval is not the place for tensor-parallel sharding;
  metrics are expected to fit on one GPU.
- **Metrics that need `mmcv` with a conflicting CUDA ABI.** Document
  the affected sub-metrics as unsupported and skip them. Building
  isolation infrastructure (subprocess engine, per-metric venv) is
  out of scope.
