## Getting Started

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to create a clean environment. If you previously used Conda, switching to uv generally gives faster and more stable installs.

```bash
# Create and activate a new uv environment
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install FastVideo on NVIDIA CUDA 12
UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu126 uv pip install fastvideo
```

Use `UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130` on CUDA 13. Apple silicon users should follow the
[MPS installation guide](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/getting_started/installation/mps/).

> **On an Apple Silicon Mac?** FastVideo runs FastMetal-QAD through an MLX
> runtime. Install with `uv pip install -e '.[mlx]'`, download
> [`FastVideo/FastMetal-1.3B-QAD`](https://huggingface.co/FastVideo/FastMetal-1.3B-QAD),
> and follow the
> [Apple Silicon guide](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/getting_started/installation/mps/).

Please see our [docs](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/getting_started/installation/) for more detailed installation instructions.

> **On an NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10 / ARM64 + CUDA 13)?** There's no prebuilt ARM wheel for the FastVideo CUDA kernel, so it's an editable from-source install (`UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install -e .`, which compiles that kernel for you) rather than `UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv pip install fastvideo`. A compatible prebuilt ARM64 FlashAttention wheel is available separately. Follow the [DGX Spark install guide](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/getting_started/installation/spark/).

### Install with an AI coding agent

FastVideo is a monorepo with rich agent guidance (see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)). If you use Claude Code, Cursor, or another coding agent, paste the prompt below — it detects your platform and follows the matching guide:

```text
Install FastVideo (https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo) into a fresh uv virtual environment.

1. Detect the platform: run `uname -m`, `nvidia-smi`, and `nvcc --version`.
2. Read and follow the matching install guide exactly (in this repo, or at
   https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/getting_started/installation/):
     - NVIDIA GPU, x86_64                         -> docs/getting_started/installation/gpu.md
     - NVIDIA DGX Spark / GB10, aarch64, CUDA 13  -> docs/getting_started/installation/spark.md
     - Apple Silicon, macOS                       -> docs/getting_started/installation/mps.md
3. Use uv for every step. If a command fails, debug it and tell me what you changed.
4. Verify the result:
     python -c "import fastvideo, torch; print('cuda', torch.cuda.is_available())"
     fastvideo --help
5. Report which platform you detected and any deviations you had to make.
```

## Sparse Distillation

For our sparse distillation techniques, please see our [distillation docs](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/distillation/dmd/) and check out our [blog](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/fastvideo_post_training/).

## Dreamverse — Realtime Video Generation & Editing

[Dreamverse](apps/dreamverse/README.md) is FastVideo's realtime video generation
and editing platform — "vibe directing" a video as it streams. It lives in the
monorepo under [`apps/dreamverse/`](apps/dreamverse/) and ships its own backend
(`dreamverse-server`) plus a web UI.

Try the [live demo](https://dreamverse.fastvideo.org/), read the
[blog](https://haoailab.com/blogs/dreamverse/), or run it yourself. Dreamverse
deploys on a local GPU, a self-hosted B200 server over SSH, Docker, or
serverless [Modal](apps/dreamverse/scripts/modal/README.md) — see the
[Dreamverse README](apps/dreamverse/README.md).

## Inference

### Generating Your First Video

Here's a minimal example to generate a video using the default settings. Make sure VSA kernels are [installed](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/FastVideo/attention/vsa/#installation). Create a file called `example.py` with the following code:

```python
import os
from fastvideo import VideoGenerator

def main():
    os.environ["FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND"] = "VIDEO_SPARSE_ATTN"

    # Create a video generator with a pre-trained model
    generator = VideoGenerator.from_pretrained(
        "FastVideo/FastWan2.1-T2V-1.3B-Diffusers",
        num_gpus=1,  # Adjust based on your hardware
    )

    # Define a prompt for your video
    prompt = "A curious raccoon peers through a vibrant field of yellow sunflowers, its eyes wide with interest."

    # Generate the video
    video = generator.generate_video(
        prompt,
        output_path="my_videos/",  # Controls where videos are saved
        save_video=True
    )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Run the script with:

```bash
python example.py
```
