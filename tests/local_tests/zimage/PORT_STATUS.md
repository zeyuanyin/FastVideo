128. FastVideo obtains those values from the pinned `config.json`.

## Current Phase

- phase: Phase 11 (post-parity review and handoff); quality reference published
- status: external_ci_gate
- owner: infra/reviewer
- last_updated: 2026-07-15

## Pinned Official Pipeline Context

- official_pipeline: `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image@26f23eda626ffadda020b04ff79488e1d72004cd`,
  `src/zimage/pipeline.py::generate` and `src/config/inference.py`
- oracle_policy: official Z-Image source only; Diffusers is not the implementation oracle
- workload_and_output: `T2I`; prompt plus optional negative prompt to PIL images, or latents when requested
- model_index_contract: `_class_name=ZImagePipeline`; required modules are `transformer`, `vae`,
  `text_encoder`, `tokenizer`, and `scheduler`
- official_defaults: `height=1024`, `width=1024`, `num_inference_steps=8`,
  `guidance_scale=0.0`, `cfg_truncation=1.0`, `max_sequence_length=512`
- reproducible_rng: `torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(42)`; the API accepts a generator and has no fixed seed default
- scheduler_contract: `use_reference_discrete_timesteps=True`, runtime `sigma_min=0.0`, endpoint-preserving
  `num_steps + 1` schedule, and no DiT call for the final zero timestep
- decode_contract: apply `(latents / 0.3611) + 0.1159` before official VAE decode
- implementation_status: native pipeline/config/preset/registry/example and the 8-step 1024x1024 PNG SSIM test are
  implemented; one-step native GPU parity is bit-exact; the L40S candidate generated at inference head `9a6dbcadc`
  was author-approved and published at dataset revision `7b27d00004b723ef0cf4923e77ae57128573f01c`

## Component Matrix

| Component | Type | Reuse/Port | Official Definition / Instantiation | FastVideo Target | Prototype | Conversion | Parity | Open Issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Production text encoder (Qwen3 body) | text_encoder | reused production passthrough | Official `src/utils/loader.py` uses Transformers with typed load then device-only move; official pipeline consumes `hidden_states[-2]` | `TextEncoderLoader` -> `Qwen3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained_local` -> body-only Transformers `AutoModel` | DONE | not_needed for current HF subfolder | PINNED GB200 PASS; reference/production outputs exact | none |

| Tokenizer | tokenizer | reused | Official loader's `AutoTokenizer` from `<weights>/tokenizer/`; official thinking template and length 512 | `TokenizerLoader` | DONE | not_needed | PINNED GB200 PASS (2 passed) | none |
| VAE | vae | reused with accepted wrapper exception | Pinned official `src/zimage/autoencoder.py`; raw decode is the component boundary | Existing Diffusers-backed `fastvideo.models.vaes.autoencoder_kl.AutoencoderKL` through production `VAELoader`, plus direct raw-decode coverage | DONE | not_needed | PINNED GB200 PASS (2 passed) | none |
| Scheduler | scheduler | reused with Z-Image extension | Pinned official `src/zimage/scheduler.py`; official pipeline sets `sigma_min=0.0` | `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler(use_reference_discrete_timesteps=True, sigma_min=0.0)` | DONE | not_needed | PINNED GB200 PASS (5 passed) | none |
| Transformer (`ZImageTransformer2DModel`) | dit | native port | Pinned official `src/zimage/transformer.py`; HF `transformer/` supplies weights only | `fastvideo.models.dits.zimage.ZImageTransformer2DModel` through `TransformerLoader` | DONE | not_needed; exact 521-key surface | PINNED GB200 PASS (5 passed; real-weight full forward exact) | none |
| Pipeline | pipeline | native same-PR implementation | Pinned official `src/zimage/pipeline.py::generate` | FastVideo `ZImagePipeline` plus config/preset/registry/example/parity | DONE | not_needed | RTX 5090 ONE-STEP LATENTS BIT-EXACT; L40S REFERENCE PUBLISHED | I005 (CI verification only) |

## Conversion State

- conversion_script: none for the reused components or native transformer
- converted_weights_dir: none
- source_layout: official repo-native Python (`Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image`)
- hf_weight_layout: per-component subfolders; not a Diffusers implementation oracle
- transformer_conversion: not_needed; official, HF index, and native names align exactly
- transformer_key_surface: 521 tensors; sorted-key SHA256 `3a9216f208c1873b2cf06394411a53e1e95e10fae3b01dca0f7223556e47c354`
- strict_load_status: transformer real-weight strict load passed; native Qwen strictness regressions passed
- passthrough_components: body-only Qwen3 `AutoModel`, tokenizer assets
- direct_load_components: native Qwen3 parity target, VAE, scheduler
- native_qwen_exclusion: `lm_head.weight` only; the native encoder owns the body, not an LM head
- native_qwen_fused_contract: every Q/K/V and gate/up shard is required unless the exact fused destination is present
- native_qwen_auxiliary_contract: mapped quantization auxiliaries, including scale parameters, must load and may not be silently discarded
- retry_history: none

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Needed By Phase | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q001 | Which exact Z-Image source revision is the parity oracle? | prep | Phase 1 | resolved | Pinned `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image@26f23eda626ffadda020b04ff79488e1d72004cd`; scheduler/VAE tests fail on a wrong HEAD or import origin. |
| Q002 | Which immutable HF snapshot supplies component weights? | prep | Phase 1 | resolved | `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo@f332072aa78be7aecdf3ee76d5c247082da564a6`. |
| Q003 | What prompt/tokenization/hidden-state contract does the official pipeline use? | pipeline | Phase 6 | resolved | `apply_chat_template(tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True, enable_thinking=True)`, tokenization length 512, and valid-token `hidden_states[-2]`. |
| Q004 | Does the native transformer require conversion? | conversion | Phase 5 | resolved | No. Pinned HF index, official production meta model, and FastVideo production meta model expose the same 521 keys; official/native key shapes match exactly. |

## Issues And Blockers

| ID | Phase | Component | Severity | Issue | Evidence | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I001 | Phase 6 | native_qwen_quality | medium | The optional native fp32 `hidden_states[-2]` tail narrowly exceeded `atol=1e-4` after smooth cross-kernel accumulation. | Exact layer trace: embeddings exact, layer-0 max `3.815e-6`, first misses at layer 33, largest failing boundary difference `1.686811e-4`; final RMSNorm passes. The required production `AutoModel` path is exact. | parity | resolved | Author approved Z-Image-only `_FP32_ATOL=2e-4` with `_FP32_RTOL=1e-4`; complete pinned GB200 suite passed 34/34 with bf16 and all other gates unchanged. |
| I002 | Phase 7 | scheduler/pipeline | high | Published `scheduler_config.json` omits the reference-schedule flag and official zero endpoint. | The native stage applies both values; hardware-free stage coverage and pinned native GPU parity pass. | pipeline | resolved | The Z-Image pipeline applies `use_reference_discrete_timesteps=True` and `sigma_min=0.0`; one-step latents match official Tongyi exactly. |
| I003 | Phase 6 | tokenizer/text_encoder | medium | Prompt formatting and target length previously differed from the official call. | Pinned source uses thinking chat template, 512 tokens, and `hidden_states[-2]`. | parity | resolved | Corrected behavior passed the pinned GB200 run. |
| I004 | Phase 4 | transformer | high | `ZImageTransformer2DModel` was not ported. | Native config/model/registry and deterministic parity test now exist. | port | resolved | Production meta surface matches all 521 pinned HF keys; tiny full-forward parity passes exactly. |
| I005 | Phase 10 | pipeline/quality | high | Verify the published L40S PNG through end-to-end SSIM CI. | Author approved the reviewed candidate; the guarded upload published exactly one file at dataset revision `7b27d000...f01c`, and remote bytes match SHA-256 `6c2be648...f7a6`. | infra | external_ci_gate | Reference publication is resolved. The full-suite launcher remains blocked by the external-fork documentation workflow's `action_required` state; merge is separate. |
| I006 | Phase 6 | text_encoder | high | HF passthrough loading inherited an ambient target-device context, and the earlier test harness incorrectly cast float32 RoPE buffers during bf16 placement. | HF loading now occurs outside the ambient context; typed load is followed by device-only movement, matching official `src/utils/loader.py`; production/independent outputs match exactly. | encoder | resolved | Hardware-free placement/default-dtype tests and the pinned GB200 production path pass. |
| I007 | Phase 6 | text_encoder | high | Lenient native loading could miss one fused source shard or an auxiliary quantization scale. | Loader completeness covers every destination, required split shard, exact fused destination, and mapped scale parameter. | encoder | resolved | Strictness regressions and pinned checkpoint loading pass. |
| I008 | Phase 6 | vae | medium | Direct decode alone did not cover production registry/config/device/strict-load behavior; the shared target is a runtime Diffusers wrapper. | VAE parity now covers direct raw decode and production `VAELoader` against official `src/zimage/autoencoder.py`. | parity | resolved | Pinned GB200 subset passed 2/2. The wrapper is an implementation exception, not the oracle; official latent normalization remains Phase 7 pipeline scope. |
| I009 | Phase 2 | reference assets | high | Adding a nonexistent clone path to `sys.path` could import another installed `zimage` package and yield false parity. | Tests now verify exact clone HEAD and module paths under `Z-Image/src`; `/Z-Image/` is ignored. | prep | resolved | Wrong SHA/path/import is a failure; absent local assets may skip. |
| I010 | Phase 6 | tokenizer | medium | Missing `apply_chat_template` previously skipped and could hide an incompatible tokenizer. | Tokenizer parity now asserts the API and exact official kwargs. | parity | resolved | Missing chat-template behavior fails; pinned asset-backed parity passed. |
| I011 | Phase 6 | transformer | high | Production real-weight strict load and full-forward parity were not verified. | Pinned 24.6 GB weights and official source were exercised on GB200. | parity | resolved | Strict load and full forward passed exactly (`max=0`, `mean=0`). |
| I012 | Phase 6 | required_components | high | Record a complete non-skip run after the loader/oracle corrections and approved native-Qwen tolerance. | Exact PR head `f310aacb1`, pinned official source `26f23eda...`, immutable HF snapshot `f332072a...`, GB200. | parity | resolved | Complete suite passed 34/34 in 94.21s with no skips; real-weight transformer output was exact (`max=0`, `mean=0`). |

## Escape Hatches

| ID | Phase | Decision Type | Question | Recommended Option | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E001 | Phase 6 | cost | Approve one standard 8-hour 4×GB200 hold to run the complete pinned component and real-weight transformer parity suite at PR #1339? | Approve `model/r9`; reuse a suitable existing allocation if available. | resolved | Author approved. Existing job `1545932` was reused, so no new hold was created. Excludes Modal, SSIM seeding/upload, and merge. |
| E002 | Phase 6 | numerical | Accept the traced Z-Image-only native encoder fp32 tail without weakening shared Qwen or bf16 gates? | Approve `model/r10`: change only `_FP32_ATOL` from `1e-4` to `2e-4`, retain `_FP32_RTOL=1e-4`, then rerun native parity at the exact resulting head. | resolved | Author approved. The one-line test threshold changed at `f310aacb1`; complete pinned GB200 suite passed 34/34 with production equality, bf16, strict-load, and official-oracle checks unchanged. |

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-15 | Publish the visually approved L40S PNG reference to `FastVideo/ssim-reference-videos`. | The author confirmed the staged image looks good and explicitly requested the HF upload. | Guarded no-force upload added one Z-Image PNG at dataset revision `7b27d000...f01c`; remote bytes match the reviewed artifact. |
| 2026-07-15 | Accept the traced Z-Image-only native encoder fp32 absolute tolerance of `2e-4` while retaining `rtol=1e-4`. | Exact tracing showed gradual fused/split-kernel accumulation rather than a semantic break; the largest failing absolute tail was `1.686811e-4`. | One test constant changed. The full pinned suite passed 34/34; production equality, bf16 thresholds, strict loading, and official Tongyi oracle are unchanged. |
| 2026-07-14 | Carry the native FastVideo pipeline, example/parity, SSIM test, and L40S seed workflow on PR #1339. | The author explicitly requested the pipeline and quality regression on the same PR rather than a follow-up. | Implementation, component closure, native GPU parity, and reference publication are complete. Later commits do not change inference math. |
| 2026-07-14 | Treat the exact production `AutoModel` loader as the required pipeline text encoder and direct native-Qwen parity as a separate quality row. | `TextEncoderLoader` calls `Qwen3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained_local`, which returns body-only Transformers `AutoModel`; the pipeline does not direct-construct FastVideo-native Qwen. | The production component is exact. The separately approved native-Qwen tolerance changed no production math. |
| 2026-07-13 | Use pinned `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image@26f23eda...` as the implementation oracle; treat HF subfolders only as weight/config assets. | The official repo defines transformer, VAE, scheduler, pipeline, and loader semantics. A runtime component may inherit Diffusers without making Diffusers the reference. | Tests verify official clone SHA/import origin; docs distinguish the oracle from storage/runtime implementation details. |
| 2026-07-13 | Keep official latent scale/shift application out of the VAE component assertion. | `(latents / 0.3611) + 0.1159` is pipeline-stage behavior, while VAE component parity compares raw decode and production loading. | The Z-Image stage implements the exact formula; pinned native GPU parity passed. |
| 2026-07-13 | Preserve the published transformer key surface and use raw masked SDPA at SP=1. | The checkpoint already matches the official class, while padded variable-length attention needs a key mask unavailable in current distributed wrappers. | No converter is needed; runtime rejects SP>1 until a mask-aware distributed path has parity evidence. |
| 2026-07-04 | Pin both external sources and treat all earlier GPU results as historical until rerun. | Earlier evidence did not record an immutable HF revision, and source imports were not origin-checked. | README has executable clone/download commands; tests enforce the source SHA; all asset-backed parity rows were revalidated. |
| 2026-07-04 | Use a body-only Transformers `AutoModel` for production and a separate `AutoModel` object to materialize the official loader contract independently. | The pinned official Z-Image source is the oracle. Every FastVideo consumer needs hidden states, not full-vocabulary logits or an LM head, and comparing an object with itself is not independent evidence. | Production avoids the LM head while parity covers production loading and native implementation separately. |
| 2026-07-04 | Make fused-source and quantization-scale completeness part of native Qwen strict loading. | A loaded destination name alone did not prove that every required Q/K/V or gate/up shard and auxiliary scale arrived. | Missing split shards or mapped scale parameters fail; an exact fused destination remains valid. |
| 2026-07-04 | Reuse the existing Diffusers-backed AutoencoderKL wrapper for the Z-Image VAE component. | The target is established shared code with production-loader parity against pinned official `src/zimage/autoencoder.py`. | The wrapper remains an implementation detail for this VAE only; official Z-Image source defines pipeline behavior and numerical parity. |
| 2026-07-04 | Treat absent chat-template behavior as incompatibility, not an optional test environment. | Thinking-format prompt construction is part of the official numerical contract. | Tokenizer parity fails when `apply_chat_template` is unavailable. |
| 2026-07-04 | Record the pinned Qwen architecture as 36 blocks, hidden size 2560, intermediate size 9728, 32 attention heads, and 8 KV heads. | Earlier notes described a different architecture and could mis-size the native target. | Config/review evidence now matches `f332072aa78be7aecdf3ee76d5c247082da564a6`; expected hidden-state length is 37. |
| 2026-06-21 | Expand generated Qwen `position_ids` to `[batch_size, seq_len]`. | The rotary layer flattens positions; `[1, seq_len]` misaligned RoPE for batch sizes greater than one. | Batch-one behavior is unchanged; pinned batch-two parity passed. |
| 2026-06-21 | Reuse the shared native `Qwen3ForCausalLM` implementation rather than maintain a second Z-Image encoder. | The shared implementation supports the same config-driven GQA, fused QKV/gate-up, and hidden-state output contract. | Registry/native parity uses the shared class; architecture values come from the pinned config. |
| 2026-05-12 | Use mean and median drift checks for deep bf16 encoder parity. | Cross-kernel fused/unfused bf16 arithmetic produces a long max-error tail; fp32 and per-layer diagnostics distinguish this from structural divergence. | Existing thresholds passed unchanged on the pinned 36-block snapshot. |
| 2026-05-12 | Forward the complete scheduler config except loader metadata. | Hand-picking three fields could silently omit future scheduler behavior. | Scheduler parity consumes all on-disk constructor fields and explicitly supplies Z-Image runtime overrides. |

## Handoff Notes

- The implementation oracle is the pinned official `Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image` clone,
  never Diffusers. Transformers is used for text components only because the
  official loader does so; HF component subfolders provide immutable assets.
- The required production text encoder is the exact body-only `AutoModel` path.
  `model/r10` is resolved: only the Z-Image test's fp32 absolute tolerance is
  `2e-4`; relative tolerance, shared Qwen math, bf16, and production loading are unchanged.
- I012 is closed by the exact-head 34/34 non-skip GB200 run at `f310aacb1`.
- Native pipeline/config/preset/registry/example, parity tests, and the 8-step
  1024x1024 PNG SSIM test are implemented. Native RTX 5090 one-step parity is
  bit-exact. The reviewed L40S PNG is live at dataset revision
  `7b27d00004b723ef0cf4923e77ae57128573f01c` with matching remote bytes.
- End-to-end SSIM/full-suite execution remains an infra/reviewer gate; reference
  publication does not authorize PR approval or merge.
