## Parity Commands

| Scope | Command | Last Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| transformer | `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_transformer_parity.py -v -s` | strict_load_and_forward_parity_pass | 2026-07-01: converted real 5B-Cam transformer shards strict-load into dedicated `DreamXWorldTransformer3DModel` with 0 shape mismatches; official-vs-FastVideo small-input fp32 forward parity passes on CUDA (`diff_max=0.072533`, `diff_mean=0.008014`). |
| vae | `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_vae_parity.py -v -s` | encode_parity_pass | 2026-06-30: official DreamX raw `Wan2.2_VAE.pth` maps 196/196 keys into FastVideo Wan VAE and encode parity passes after applying the same official latent normalization (`(mu - mean) / std`). |
| text_encoder | `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_text_encoder_parity.py -v -s` | hidden_state_parity_pass | 2026-06-30: official `WanT5EncoderModel` vs FastVideo `UMT5EncoderModel` hidden-state parity passes on CUDA using staged Wan2.2 text encoder/tokenizer weights and reference-only `xfuser` stubs. |
| scheduler | `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_scheduler_parity.py -v -s` | non_skip_pass | 2026-06-30: FastVideo FlowMatch scheduler matches official Diffusers timesteps and step output for DreamX default Flow sampler; `DreamXWorldPipeline` initializes FlowMatch with official `shift=3.0`. |

| pipeline_config | `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_pipeline_config.py -v -s` | pipeline_entry_preset_scheduler_modelinfo_and_camera_stage_smoke_pass | DreamX 5B-Cam PipelineConfig wires DiT/VAE/UMT5/Flow/TI2V settings and official `shift=3.0`; default preset is registered for `GD-ML/DreamX-World-5B-Cam`; local converted-style `model_index.json` resolves to `DreamXWorldPipeline`; the pipeline initializes FlowMatch, camera conditioning writes `batch.extra["dreamx_y_camera"]`, and generic denoising can pass it as `y_camera`. |
| ar_transformer | `PYTHONPATH=/workspace/FastVideo python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_ar_conversion.py tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/test_dreamx_world_ar_transformer_parity.py -q -rs` | 6_passed_0_skipped | 2026-07-02: AR converter writes symlinked transformer layout/model_index; tiny official `CausalWanModel` vs FastVideo `DreamXWorldARTransformer3DModel` forward parity passes; real 5B `model.safetensors` strict-loads with zero missing/unexpected keys from `/tmp/converted_dreamx_world_ar`. |

| ar_ssim_default | `PYTHONPATH=/workspace/FastVideo FASTVIDEO_SSIM_MODEL_ID=DreamX-World-5B DREAMX_WORLD_AR_SSIM_MODEL_PATH=/tmp/converted_dreamx_world_ar python -m pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/test_dreamx_world_similarity.py -q -rs --skip-ssim-reference-download` | 1_passed_0_skipped | 2026-07-02: A40 default AR SSIM reference seeded locally at `fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos/default/A40_reference_videos/DreamX-World-5B/TORCH_SDPA/`; helper removes stale generated base MP4 before generation; default params are 192x192, 81 frames, 4 steps, seed 2048, min SSIM 0.98. |
| ar_ssim_modal_l40s | `modal run /tmp/modal_dreamx_ar_ssim_git.py` | 1_passed_0_skipped | 2026-07-02: Modal L40S run checked out `post-fix dreamx-world-5b-cam branch commit`, downloaded default `L40S_reference_videos` via `reference_videos_cli.py download`, used cached converted AR weights under `/root/data/dreamx_world_ar_converted`, seeded the missing AR L40S reference from generated output, reran a fresh generated-vs-reference compare successfully (`mean_ssim=1.0`), and exported the reference to Modal volume `hf-model-weights:dreamx_ar_ssim_l40s`. Downloaded local reference decodes as 81 frames of `(192, 192, 3)`. A40-vs-L40S reference spot check after deterministic AR noise fix: mean SSIM 0.7770, min 0.6139, max 0.9944. |

## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Owner | Needed By Phase | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q001 | Should first PR expose only the `DreamX-World-5B-Cam` 5s camera-control mode and exclude AR long-horizon forcing? | user | prep | resolved | User approved starting with `DreamX-World-5B-Cam`; AR long-horizon is out of first-PR scope. |
| Q002 | Does FastVideo's existing Wan2.2 TI2V transformer support DreamX PRoPE/control adapter with a small extension, or is a DreamX-specific DiT required? | component:transformer | Phase 3 | resolved | Project guidance prefers a separate DreamX DiT for maintainability. DreamX PRoPE/control adapter now lives in `fastvideo/models/dits/dreamx_world.py`; Wan DiT/config have no DreamX-specific fields or `y_camera` signature. |
| Q003 | Which sampler is in first-PR scope: official default `Flow` only, or also `Flow_Unipc` and `Flow_DPM++`? | orchestrator | Phase 3 | resolved | First PR should support official default `Flow` only. FastVideo FlowMatch scheduler parity is non-skip PASS; optional `Flow_Unipc` and `Flow_DPM++` are out of first-PR scope. |
| Q004 | Which HF token env var should be used if rate limits or gated Wan2.2 base weights require auth? | user | Phase 5 | resolved | No auth was required for the completed local downloads; keep using env var names only if future gated repos require auth. |
| Q005 | Should native FastVideo production code depend on DreamX reference-only packages such as `xfuser` or OpenCV? | user | Phase 3 | resolved | No. These packages may be used only for official reference/local parity setup; native FastVideo integration must remove that runtime requirement. |
| Q006 | Should AR handoff require a full generated long-horizon video in this no-HF-token/no-GPU-budget pass? | user/runtime | pipeline | resolved | A40 long-horizon generation passes with 1005 frames at 64x64/4 steps. AR default SSIM passes locally on A40 and on Modal L40S with a 192x192/81-frame reference. HF upload/publication remains a separate operation if the reference dataset should be updated upstream. |
| Q007 | Can A40 references stand in for L40S CI references? | quality | release | resolved | No. After deterministic AR noise fix, A40-vs-L40S reference mean SSIM is 0.7770, below the 0.98 same-device threshold. Publish the L40S-specific reference for CI. |

## Issues And Blockers

| ID | Phase | Component | Severity | Issue | Evidence | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I001 | prep | official_env | medium | Official import initially failed because `xfuser` was missing. | `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'xfuser'` from `python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'DreamX-World'); import inference_dreamx5b"` | prep | resolved | Installed `xfuser==0.4.1`; import progressed. |
| I002 | prep | official_env | medium | Official import then failed because GUI OpenCV required missing system `libxcb.so.1`. | `ImportError: libxcb.so.1: cannot open shared object file` through `cv2` import in Diffusers ConsisID path. | prep | resolved | Installed `opencv-python-headless`; `import inference_dreamx5b` passed. |
| I003 | prep | weights | medium | HF repo has raw official transformer shards and no Diffusers `model_index.json`. | `inspect_hf_layout.py GD-ML/DreamX-World-5B-Cam --json` returned `source_layout=raw_official`, `needs_conversion=yes`, `model_index_class=null`. | conversion | resolved | Downloaded raw DreamX shards to `official_weights/dreamx_world`; converted transformer to `converted_weights/dreamx_world/transformer`; symlinked reusable Wan2.2 Diffusers components; real 5B transformer strict-load passes. |
| I004 | prep | dependencies | high | Official reference import required extra packages in the local environment, but FastVideo native runtime should not inherit those dependencies. | `xfuser==0.4.1` and `opencv-python-headless` were installed only to make `DreamX-World/inference_dreamx5b.py` import for reference/parity. | pipeline | resolved | Production DreamX FastVideo code uses native camera/image/video utilities and has no runtime `xfuser` or OpenCV import requirement; those packages remain reference-only local parity dependencies. |
| I005 | parity | transformer | medium | Transformer full forward parity initially failed in bf16 official harness. | Official CUDA bf16 LayerNorm path was unstable; fp32 small-input harness avoids that dtype issue and compares against FastVideo with single-process SP identity patches. | component:transformer | resolved | Official-vs-FastVideo forward parity now passes on CUDA with `diff_max=0.072533`, `diff_mean=0.008014`. |
| I006 | parity | vae/text_encoder | medium | VAE/text parity initially remained skipped after weights were staged. | Text official import needed a reference-only `xfuser` stub; VAE comparison initially used raw official normalized latents against FastVideo raw mu. | component:vae,component:text_encoder | resolved | Text hidden-state parity passes. VAE encode parity passes after raw key mapping and applying the official latent normalization to FastVideo output. |
| I007 | quality | pipeline_ti2v | medium | Real image-path TI2V smoke initially failed when `vae_cpu_offload=True` because DenoisingStage encoded the first frame while the VAE weights remained on CPU. | DreamX SSIM first run failed with `RuntimeError: Input type (torch.cuda.FloatTensor) and weight type (torch.FloatTensor) should be the same` at `fastvideo/pipelines/stages/denoising.py` VAE encode. | pipeline | resolved | DenoisingStage now moves the VAE to `local_device` before TI2V first-frame encode; image-path pipeline smoke and DreamX SSIM both pass. |
| I008 | quality | ssim_helper | high | SSIM helper could compare against a stale generated base MP4 when a rerun saved the new video as `_1.mp4`. | Existing generated outputs made AR reference seeding appear to pass before a fresh generated-vs-reference compare. | quality | resolved | `run_text_to_video_similarity_test` and `run_image_to_video_similarity_test` now remove the stale generated base MP4 before generation. A40 and Modal L40S AR SSIM were rerun after the fix. |
| I009 | quality | ar_denoising | high | AR denoising added CUDA noise without using the request seed when the original generator was CPU-backed. | Fresh reruns against old AR references produced mean SSIM near 0.05. | pipeline | resolved | `DreamXWorldARCausalDenoisingStage` now derives a device-local generator from the request seed for AR noise. Fresh same-device A40 and L40S reruns pass with mean SSIM 1.0 after reseeding references. |

## Escape Hatches

| ID | Phase | Decision Type | Question | Recommended Option | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-29 | First PR scope is `DreamX-World-5B-Cam` only. | Cam mode is closest to existing Wan2.2 TI2V support; AR forcing needs separate causal/KV pipeline work. | Component inventory and parity focus on `inference_dreamx5b.py` and `pipeline_dreamxworld.py`. |
| 2026-06-29 | Do not install full DreamX requirements during prep. | Full requirements pin core FastVideo stack packages. | Installed only `xfuser==0.4.1` and `opencv-python-headless` to make official imports work. |
| 2026-06-29 | Treat HF DreamX-World-5B-Cam weights as raw official transformer layout requiring conversion. | HF inspection found no `model_index.json`. | Phase 5 must create `scripts/checkpoint_conversion/dreamx_world_to_diffusers.py` after component prototype/key dumps. |
| 2026-06-29 | Do not add DreamX reference-only dependencies to FastVideo production requirements. | The current environment should remain the FastVideo environment; extra packages are only for official reference parity. | Native DreamX integration must avoid runtime `xfuser` and OpenCV requirements unless explicitly approved later. |
| 2026-06-29 | Implement DreamX camera conditioning as native FastVideo utility. | It is weightless and removes the need to import DreamX reference utilities at production runtime. | `fastvideo/pipelines/basic/dreamx_world/camera_conditioning.py` now has non-skip parity against official action-to-PRoPE tensors. |
| 2026-06-29 | First PR supports DreamX default `Flow` sampler only. | FastVideo FlowMatch Euler scheduler matches the official Diffusers scheduler for DreamX defaults. | Pipeline work can use FastVideo native FlowMatch scheduler; UniPC and DPM++ are out of first-PR scope. |
| 2026-07-01 | Keep DreamX PRoPE/control adapter in a dedicated DreamX DiT class. | Project guidance is that putting too much DreamX behavior into Wan makes the model hard to manage. | `fastvideo/models/dits/dreamx_world.py` defines `DreamXWorldTransformer3DModel`, `DreamXWorldTransformerBlock`, and `DreamXPropeSelfAttention`; `fastvideo/configs/models/dits/dreamx_world.py` owns DreamX adapter config fields; Wan DiT/config are unchanged from DreamX. |
| 2026-06-30 | Camera parity test loads official camera functions by file instead of importing the official `utils` package. | Official package initialization pulls unrelated dependencies that can require GUI OpenCV system libraries. | Camera parity remains non-skip without adding DreamX reference-only dependencies to FastVideo production requirements. |
| 2026-06-30 | Add DreamX-World-5B-Cam model and pipeline config helpers plus a conversion script. | Official HF DreamX 5B-Cam transformer config is 30 layers, hidden size 3072, 24 heads, 48 latent channels, plus Wan2.2 48-channel VAE and UMT5-XXL text encoder. | DreamX helpers wire DiT/VAE/UMT5/Flow/TI2V settings; `dreamx_world_to_diffusers.py` writes a FastVideo-loadable transformer config plus renamed safetensors; strict-load smoke passes on a tiny official DreamX transformer and the real 5B converted shards. |
| 2026-06-30 | Pass DreamX camera PRoPE condition through the FastVideo batch/denoising path. | DreamX transformer expects `y_camera={"viewmats", "K"}` at denoising time. | `DreamXWorldPipeline` is registered as a basic pipeline entry and initializes the official default FlowMatch scheduler; `dreamx_world_5b_cam` preset mirrors official 5B-Cam defaults; `DreamXWorldCameraConditioningStage` writes `batch.extra["dreamx_y_camera"]`; generic denoising filters and forwards it as `y_camera` only for compatible transformers. |

## Handoff Notes

- Prep, component parity, pipeline smoke/parity, and the basic example validation are complete for `DreamX-World-5B-Cam`.
- Official reference clone is staged at `DreamX-World/` and ignored by git.
- Workspace-local weights are staged: DreamX raw transformer shards under `official_weights/dreamx_world`, Wan2.2 raw base artifacts under `official_weights/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B`, and Wan2.2 Diffusers reusable components under `official_weights/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers`.
- Camera conditioning parity is active and passing without weights.
- Default Flow scheduler parity is active and passing without weights.
- Transformer has corrected official 5B-Cam architecture in dedicated DreamX DiT/config files, native PRoPE/control-adapter, conversion mapping, real converted 5B strict-load, and official-vs-FastVideo forward parity passing on CUDA. VAE encode parity and text hidden-state parity pass on CUDA. Pipeline entry/registry, local model_info resolution, preset, config, FlowMatch scheduler init, camera stage, denoising `y_camera` kwarg smokes, independent CUDA pipeline smoke/parity, and a small saved-video basic example pass.
- Full local DreamX component suite is non-skip PASS: `python -m pytest tests/local_tests/dreamx_world/ -q -rs` returned `26 passed` on 2026-07-01. Pipeline smoke/parity and SSIM quality regression are also non-skip PASS locally.
- Keep `xfuser` and OpenCV as reference-only parity dependencies. Do not add them
  to FastVideo requirements or production imports.


## Quality Regression

- status: `added`
- test: `fastvideo/tests/ssim/test_dreamx_world_similarity.py`
- command: `PYTHONPATH=/workspace/FastVideo FASTVIDEO_SSIM_MODEL_ID=DreamX-World-5B-Cam python -m pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/test_dreamx_world_similarity.py -q -rs`
- result: `1 passed, 0 skipped` on 2026-07-01
- reference: Local A40/TORCH_SDPA reference seeded from the generated candidate under `fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos/default/A40_reference_videos/DreamX-World-5B-Cam/TORCH_SDPA/`. The test uses a deterministic generated input image, 64x64 request dimensions, 9 frames, 1 denoise step, seed 1024, and min SSIM 0.98. Full-quality params are present for 480x832/161 frames/30 steps.
- note: Modal L40S seeding passed using the configured Modal profile and unauthenticated HF public downloads. HF upload/publication still requires `HF_API_KEY`, `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN`, or `HF_TOKEN` with write access; no token values were used or recorded.

| 2026-07-02 | Add DreamX-World-5B autoregressive support. | Official AR repo is raw single-safetensors layout and needs a dedicated causal/KV stage. | Added native AR DiT/config, identity converter, AR pipeline config/preset/registry, and targeted non-skip tests. Raw AR weights are staged at `/tmp/dreamx_world_ar_weights`; converted symlink layout at `/tmp/converted_dreamx_world_ar`. |
| 2026-07-02 | Validate DreamX-World-5B AR short full generation on A40. | Targeted parity/config tests prove components, but end-to-end runtime can still fail at scheduler, RoPE cache, device, or decode boundaries. | `DreamXWorldARPipeline` generated and saved a 64x64/9-frame/4-step MP4 from `/tmp/converted_dreamx_world_ar`; the saved MP4 decodes to 9 frames. |
| 2026-07-02 | Validate DreamX-World-5B AR long-horizon and default SSIM on A40. | AR needs coverage beyond the 9-frame smoke to exercise longer KV/cache progression and a quality regression path. | 1005-frame 64x64/4-step generation passes and decodes; default AR SSIM test uses 192x192/81 frames because MS-SSIM requires short side >160. |
| 2026-07-02 | Validate DreamX-World-5B AR default SSIM on Modal L40S. | CI references are device-specific; A40 alone is not enough for L40S reference coverage. | Modal checked out `post-fix dreamx-world-5b-cam branch commit`, downloaded existing default L40S references, seeded the missing AR reference, reran SSIM successfully (`mean_ssim=1.0`), and exported the L40S reference back to the workspace. |
