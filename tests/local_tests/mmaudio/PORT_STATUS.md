## Native Components

| Component | FastVideo implementation | Reuse/port decision | Real-weight result |
|---|---|---|---|
| MMAudio transformer | `fastvideo/models/dits/mmaudio.py` | Native 1D multimodal DiT | exact |
| DFN5B text/vision | `fastvideo/models/encoders/mmaudio_clip.py` | Shared native CLIP core, MMAudio adapters | exact |
| Synchformer visual encoder | `fastvideo/models/encoders/mmaudio_synchformer.py` | Shared backbone under `fastvideo/third_party/synchformer` | exact, including 16-frame/stride-8 usage contract |
| 44.1 kHz VAE | `fastvideo/models/audio/mmaudio_vae.py` | Native audio component | exact state structure, FP32/BF16 random-weight decoder, and real-weight encode/decode parity |
| BigVGAN-v2 | `fastvideo/models/audio/bigvgan.py` | Shared native vocoder | exact |
| Euler flow schedule | shared `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler` | Reuse schedule; preserve official BF16 scalar update in MMAudio stage | exact |

## Pipeline Integration

- Pipeline: `fastvideo/pipelines/basic/mmaudio/MMAudioPipeline`
- Config: `fastvideo/configs/pipelines/mmaudio.py::MMAudioV2AConfig`
- Preset: `mmaudio_large_44k_v2`
- Registry: resolves both `WorkloadType.V2A` and `WorkloadType.T2A`
- Required production components: `transformer`, `scheduler`, `text_encoder`,
  `tokenizer`, `image_encoder`, `image_encoder_2`, `audio_vae`, `vocoder`
- Output: mono `[B,1,samples]`, 44.1 kHz, exposed through FastVideo's
  audio-only result contract and saved as WAV by `VideoGenerator`
- Duration: dynamic sequence lengths, with 8 seconds retained only as the
  published training/default duration; longer and shorter inference is accepted
- Existing T2V/I2V/T2I pipelines are not routed through these stages.

The V2A preprocessing contract is identical to official MMAudio:

1. timestamp sampling at 8 FPS for DFN5B and 25 FPS for Synchformer;
2. DFN path: bicubic resize to `384x384`, float `[0,1]`, CLIP normalization;
3. sync path: bicubic short-side resize to 224, center crop, normalize to `[-1,1]`;
4. Synchformer: 16-frame windows, stride 8, `(segment,time)` token flattening.

## Converted Checkpoint

- Converter: `scripts/checkpoint_conversion/convert_mmaudio_to_diffusers.py`
- Local artifact: `converted_weights/mmaudio/large_44k_v2`
- Production strict load: pass for all eight components
- Total local artifact size: about 9.1 GB
- Converted weights and official assets remain ignored/untracked.

## Parity Evidence

| Scope | Result |
|---|---|
| Official/FastVideo video preprocessing | exact (`clip max_abs=0`, `sync max_abs=0`) |
| Condition features, random latent, projected conditions | exact |
| First flow prediction and 25-step final latent | exact |
| Final 2-second V2A waveform (89,088 samples) | exact (`atol=0`, `rtol=0`) |
| Real 10-second variable-duration V2A | pass (441,344 samples, 10.0078 s) |
| Default FastVideo offload path | real one-step smoke pass |
| Local suite | full rerun pending; VAE FP32/BF16 random-weight and real-weight cases pass |
| VAE component parity | state structure and FP32/BF16 random-weight decoder parity pass on GB200 (`atol=1e-6`, `rtol=1e-6`); real-weight encode/decode parity passes (`atol=1e-5`, `rtol=1e-5`) |
| Exact-head GB200 V2A examples | two 5-second, 25-step, seed-42 generations pass; each output is mono PCM16 at 44.1 kHz with 221,184 samples |

Commands:

```bash
pytest -q tests/local_tests/mmaudio

MMAUDIO_RUN_PIPELINE_PARITY=1 \
MMAUDIO_PARITY_VIDEO=/path/to/video-at-least-2s.mp4 \
pytest -q tests/local_tests/mmaudio/test_mmaudio_pipeline_parity.py::test_mmaudio_real_v2a_pipeline_waveform_parity -s
```

The opt-in real pipeline gate passed on an RTX 6000 Ada with the downloaded
official `large_44k_v2`, DFN5B, Synchformer, VAE, and BigVGAN assets.

## Important Numeric Decisions

- OpenCLIP text uses the explicit additive causal mask used by
  `nn.MultiheadAttention`; SDPA's `is_causal` shortcut rounds differently in BF16.
- The Euler time/delta scalars stay on CPU, matching official MMAudio's
  `torch.linspace` loop. Moving those float32 scalars to CUDA changes BF16 promotion.
- `t_embed.freqs` is materialized in BF16 after meta loading; dynamic RoPE buffers
  are rebuilt in FP32 exactly as official `update_seq_lengths` does.
- MMAudio VAE and BigVGAN weight norm is removed on CPU in FP32 before casting to
  BF16, matching the official feature utility construction order.

## Deferred Scope

- Publishing the converted checkpoint and immutable source revisions.
- Optional source-video mux/re-encode helper; the current V2A result is WAV/audio.
- 16 kHz and small/medium variants.
- Sequence/tensor-parallel optimization.
- Training integration. The official repository does not support training the
  `_v2` variant; any training port should start from a v1 44.1 kHz checkpoint.
