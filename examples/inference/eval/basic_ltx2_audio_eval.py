"""Generate one LTX2 video and score its audio track.

LTX2 produces video + audio and muxes both into the output mp4. The
eval suite reads the audio track straight out of that mp4 (librosa
decodes via ffmpeg under the hood), so we just point the audio
metrics at the same path.

Only the reference-free audio metrics run here — they're the ones
that make sense for a single one-shot generation:

  * ``audio.clap_score``         — CLAP text↔audio cosine similarity
  * ``audio.audiobox_aesthetics`` — AudioBox 4-axis quality score

The other audio metrics need extra inputs we don't have for a
one-shot run: ``audio.frechet_distance`` and ``audio.kl_divergence``
need a reference audio, ``audio.wer`` needs a ground-truth transcript.

Install: ``uv pip install -e .[eval-audio]`` covers both metrics here
(and the rest of the audio suite).
