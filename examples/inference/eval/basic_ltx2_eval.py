"""Generate one LTX2 video and score it with VBench metrics.

The generation block is the same as
``examples/inference/basic/basic_ltx2.py`` — same prompt, same model,
same shape, same num_frames. After ``shutdown()`` the script loads the
mp4 back, builds a single :class:`fastvideo.eval.Evaluator`, and runs
the prompt-aware VBench subset that's meaningful for an arbitrary
text→video sample.

The first run downloads CLIP / DINO / RAFT / AMT / ViCLIP / MUSIQ
weights to ``~/.cache/fastvideo/eval/`` (~few GB total).

GPU memory caveat
-----------------
Scoring 1088×1920×121 with all 8 metrics needs a dedicated GPU (~80 GB).
On a shared GPU, ``vbench.motion_smoothness`` (AMT correlation volume)
will OOM — its memory autoscale reads ``total_memory`` rather than
``mem_get_info()`` free memory and therefore underestimates the
required scale-down. Drop ``motion_smoothness`` from ``METRICS`` if
sharing, or run on a smaller-resolution generation.
