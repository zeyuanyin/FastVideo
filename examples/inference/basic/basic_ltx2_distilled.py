          "of a woman and a man in their 30s, facing each other with serious "
          "expressions. The woman, emotional and dramatic, says softly, \"That's "
          "it... Dad's lost it. And we've lost Dad.\" The man exhales, slightly "
          "annoyed: \"Stop being so dramatic, Jess.\" A beat. He glances aside, "
          "then mutters defensively, \"He's just having fun.\" The camera slowly "
          "pans right, revealing the grandfather in the garden wearing enormous "
          "butterfly wings, waving his arms in the air like he's trying to take "
          "off. He shouts, \"Wheeeew!\" as he flaps his wings with full commitment. "
          "The woman covers her face, on the verge of tears. The tone is deadpan, "
          "absurd, and quietly tragic.")
