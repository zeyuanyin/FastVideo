# QAD recipe -- quantization-aware finetune of Kandinsky5 T2V (480p) with
# fake-quant (Attn-QAT) attention.
#
# The fake-quantized attention path is selected purely by env var
# (config-driven, no monkey-patching): FASTVIDEO_ATTENTION_BACKEND=ATTN_QAT_TRAIN
# routes Kandinsky5's dense/local attention through the fake-quantized
# straight-through-estimator kernel, so the DiT learns to absorb the
# quantization error instead of fighting it. No weight quantization happens
# during this stage; that's applied post-hoc at inference time (see the
# stage-2 config and README).
#
# Scope: T2V, 480p only, dense/local attention only -- NABLA sparse attention
# is never engaged by Kandinsky5Model at this resolution.
#
# Data: preprocess with fastvideo/pipelines/preprocess/preprocess_kandinsky5_overfit.py
# (or an equivalent parquet dataset matching pyarrow_schema_t2v) first.
#
# Next: this writes a raw DCP checkpoint (checkpoint-N/dcp + metadata/RNG
# state), not something stage 2 can load directly. Pass that checkpoint to
# ../../distribution_matching/kandinsky5/distill_dmd_qat.sh, which converts
# it with fastvideo.train.entrypoint.dcp_to_diffusers (--verify) and feeds
# the export to all three models.*.init_from overrides automatically.
