# Gate the path-aware Buildkite merge plan on the cheap GitHub checks.
#
# Polls the workflow runs for the PR head commit and only exits 0 once the
# watched cheap workflows (pre-commit, docs build) have succeeded, so the
# 'ready' label cannot burn path-selected GPU lanes on a head that a cheap
# check has already doomed.
#
# Semantics:
#   - watched run completed with a bad conclusion  -> exit 1 (fail CLOSED:
#     no merge gate; the next push re-arms via the 'synchronize' trigger)
#   - watched run cancelled                         -> still pending: the docs
#     workflow's repo-global 'pages' concurrency group cancels runs superseded
#     by unrelated pushes, so 'cancelled' is not a verdict on this PR
#   - watched runs pending                          -> poll until done
#   - docs run absent                               -> not applicable after a
#     short grace period ('Deploy Documentation' is path-filtered on PRs)
#   - pre-commit run absent                         -> keep polling: pre-commit
#     is never path-filtered, so its absence is always anomalous
#   - 'ready' label removed while waiting           -> exit 1 (fail CLOSED:
#     un-labeling is a deliberate maintainer action)
#   - GitHub API unreachable or timeout             -> exit 0 (fail OPEN,
#     loud warning: never brick CI on a GitHub outage)

# Required env: PR_SHA (PR head commit), PR_NUMBER, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GH_TOKEN.
