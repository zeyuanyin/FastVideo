description: Re-seed the HF performance-tracking baseline for an intentional runtime, dependency, environment-caused benchmark shift, or reviewed v2 calibration using one or more reviewed normalized performance JSONs. Use when performance CI fails because metrics such as latency, throughput, component time, or peak memory changed for an accepted reason and the rolling median baseline in FastVideo/performance-tracking must be advanced, or when a new v2 exact comparable identity needs its first approved baseline. The workflow backs up existing history under /tmp, validates all source JSONs for the same legacy (model_id, gpu_type) target or the same v2 exact identity, rejects internally inconsistent source batches, uploads one success=true baseline record per accepted source JSON, and offers to clean local temp state after a successful upload.

# Re-seed Performance Baseline

## Purpose

Replace or advance the rolling performance baseline in the HF dataset
`FastVideo/performance-tracking`. Legacy targets are scoped by
`(model_id, gpu_type)`. V2 targets are scoped by exact comparable identity:
`workload_id`, `variant_id`, `benchmark_version`, `hardware_profile_id`,
`software_profile_id`, and `recipe_fingerprint`.

Performance comparison uses the median of up to the last 5 successful,
baseline-eligible records for the same target. Failed or calibration-only
records are useful audit history, but they do not move the future baseline
because `compare_baseline.py` loads records with `successful_only=True` and
`baseline_eligible_only=True`.

This skill now reseeds from a reviewed batch of one or more source performance
JSONs. It uploads one new `success=true` record per accepted source JSON; it
does not blindly replicate one measurement into 3 or 5 records. The effective
reseed size is therefore dynamic and equals the number of provided, validated,
internally consistent source JSONs.

For baseline shifts with existing history, if the operator provides fewer than
3 records, call out that the last-5 rolling median may not move immediately. If
the operator provides 3 consistent shifted records, the rolling median usually
moves immediately. If the operator provides 5 consistent shifted records, the
last-5 window is effectively reset to the new runtime profile. For the first
approved v2 baseline of a new exact identity, one reviewed calibration seed is
enough for the next comparable run to leave `CALIBRATION_NEEDED`.

These records are intentional operator-approved baseline resets, not ordinary
independent main-branch persistence. Mark them clearly with provenance fields
so the HF history remains auditable.

Use this skill when a performance test fails for an intentional and reviewed
reason, such as a torch/runtime/container upgrade that legitimately increases
peak memory or changes timings. This is the performance equivalent of
`reseed-ssim-references`: backup first, scope tightly, require explicit human
approval, then upload reviewed accepted baseline records.

## When to use

- A PR or main run failed the rolling performance comparison by more than the
  allowed regression threshold, and maintainers agree the shift is caused by
  an intentional runtime, dependency, hardware image, or benchmark environment
  change rather than a FastVideo logic regression.
- One or more shifted source result JSONs have been reviewed and accepted, and
  the operator wants to use those exact reviewed results to advance the rolling
  baseline.
- The source batch is internally consistent: no provided source JSON regresses
  against the batch median by more than the configured tolerance.

## When not to use

- The benchmark failure might be a real code regression. Fix or investigate
  the code path first.
- The fixed benchmark thresholds in
  `.buildkite/performance-benchmarks/tests/*.json` are too low. Those are a
  separate gate from the rolling HF baseline and may need a code review change.
- There is no clear source run, commit, and rationale. Baseline history is a
  production signal; do not edit it without provenance.
- The provided source JSONs disagree materially with each other. Rerun or
  investigate instead of uploading a noisy reseed batch.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `model_id` | Legacy required; v2 inferred | Benchmark id, e.g. `wan-t2v-1.3b-2gpu`. This maps to the HF subdirectory after `sanitize(model_id)`. For v2 records, use the `model_id` from each source artifact only as the upload directory; comparison is by exact identity. |
| `gpu_type` | Legacy required; v2 inferred | Exact GPU device string from the performance record, e.g. the L40S device name emitted by CI. V2 hardware matching uses `hardware_profile_id`; preserve `gpu_type` as display metadata. |
| `source_results` | Yes | One or more local paths or Buildkite artifact URLs for accepted shifted performance JSONs. Prefer normalized `normalized_perf_*.json` artifacts emitted by `compare_baseline.py`. Accept `source_result` as an alias only for a single JSON. |
| `max_intra_batch_regression` | No | Maximum allowed regression of any source JSON against the source batch median. Default: `0.05` (5%). |
| `intent_rationale` | Yes | One-line explanation for why the baseline shift is legitimate. This is written into provenance and should be reused in the PR. |

Hardcoded defaults:

- HF repo: `FastVideo/performance-tracking` (`HF_REPO_ID` override is
  supported by the code, but use the default unless the user explicitly asks).
- Local sync root: `/tmp/perf-tracking` (`PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT` override
  is supported).
- Prepared-record staging root: `/tmp/performance_reseed_prepared`
  (`PERFORMANCE_RESEED_STAGING_ROOT` override is supported). Keep it separate
  and non-nested from the sync root.
- Backup root: `/tmp/performance_reseed_backup`.
- Download scratch root for source artifact URLs: `/tmp/performance_reseed_source`.
- Baseline window: last 5 `success=true`, `baseline_eligible=true` records
  for the same legacy `(model_id, gpu_type)` target or the same v2 exact
  comparable identity.
- Reseed count: dynamic. Upload exactly one accepted seed record per validated
  source JSON.

## Steps

### 1. Validate the target and source results

Normalize `source_results` to a list. If the user passes a single
`source_result`, treat it as a one-element `source_results` list and report
that a single record may not move the last-5 median immediately.

If any source result is a Buildkite artifact URL, download it first into a
local scratch directory under `/tmp/performance_reseed_source/` and use the
downloaded JSON path for the rest of the workflow. If the agent cannot access
the artifact because Buildkite authentication is missing, ask the user to
download the artifact manually and provide the local path.

Prefer the normalized Buildkite artifact emitted by `compare_baseline.py`:

```text
perf_reports/results/normalized_perf_*.json
```

That file is already in the HF tracking schema. Load each normalized JSON
directly:

```python
import json

with open(source_result, encoding="utf-8") as f:
    record = json.load(f)
```

Classify the source batch before continuing:

- **Legacy source records** have no v2 exact identity fields. Stop if any
  normalized record's `model_id` or `gpu_type` does not match the requested
  `model_id` and `gpu_type`.
- **V2 source records** have exact identity fields. Stop unless every source
  record has all six comparable identity fields and they are identical across
  the batch: `workload_id`, `variant_id`, `benchmark_version`,
  `hardware_profile_id`, `software_profile_id`, and `recipe_fingerprint`.
  Do not fall back to legacy `(model_id, gpu_type)` matching for v2 records.

The source records may have `success: false` when they came from failed
rolling baseline comparisons. That is expected; only the reviewed reseed
records become new `success: true` baseline records after explicit approval.
For a first v2 baseline seed, the source records must instead be successful
scheduled-main full-suite `CALIBRATION_NEEDED` normalized artifacts. Reject PR,
local, direct-run, non-main-branch, or non-full-suite calibration artifacts as
seed sources.

Sort validated source records by their original `timestamp` ascending before
preparing the seed records. If a source timestamp is missing or unparsable,
preserve input order for those records and print a warning. This makes the
fresh reseed timestamps deterministic and makes it clear which records enter
the last-5 window when more than 5 source JSONs are provided.

Check that `HF_API_KEY` is exported. The sync path may be public, but the
upload path requires write access.

### 1a. Check source batch consistency

Before syncing or preparing uploads, reject source batches that are internally
inconsistent. Use the same metric direction as `compare_baseline.py`:

- Lower is better: `latency`, `memory`, `text_encoder_time_s`, `dit_time_s`,
  `vae_decode_time_s`.
- Higher is better: `throughput`.

For each metric with at least two non-null source values:

1. Compute the source batch median.
2. For lower-is-better metrics, compute `(source_value - batch_median) / batch_median`.
3. For `throughput`, compute `(batch_median - source_value) / batch_median`.
4. Stop if any source record regresses against the batch median by more than
   `max_intra_batch_regression`.

Default `max_intra_batch_regression` to `0.05`. Print a table with per-source values, batch median, and
worst intra-batch regression.

This check prevents uploading a mixed batch where one JSON is materially
slower or faster than the others. If the batch fails this check, ask the user
to provide a cleaner batch or explicitly investigate the variance. Do not
silently drop outliers unless the user gives a concrete reviewed reason and a
new source list.

### 1b. How to obtain source results from CI

The performance CI exports normalized source results for failed rolling
baseline comparisons when `compare_baseline.py` ran. The preferred artifacts
come from:

```text
perf_reports/results/normalized_perf_*.json
```

The normal operator flow is:

1. Open the failed Buildkite performance job or several reruns of the same
   benchmark after the accepted environment shift.
2. Download the `normalized_perf_*.json` artifacts for the target benchmark.
3. Pass all reviewed local paths or artifact URLs as `source_results`.

Do not scrape the Markdown performance summary to reconstruct JSON. The
normalized JSON artifacts are the only supported source of truth for reseed
metrics and provenance. Raw `fastvideo/tests/performance/results/perf_*.json`
artifacts are not accepted by this skill. If no normalized JSON artifact is
present, that run is not a valid source for baseline reseeding.

### 2. Sync and back up existing HF records under /tmp

Use `fastvideo/performance/hf_store.py` helpers directly. Do **not** use
`compare_baseline.py` as a sync shortcut; on full main runs it can persist
records, while this step must only fetch and back up existing history.

The sync command pattern is:

```bash
export PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT="${PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT:-/tmp/perf-tracking}"
export HF_REPO_ID="${HF_REPO_ID:-FastVideo/performance-tracking}"
python -c 'from fastvideo.performance.hf_store import sync_from_hf; import os; sync_from_hf(os.environ["PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT"], strict=True)'
```

For legacy records, back up the sanitized model directory under `/tmp`:

```bash
SHORT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
MODEL_SAFE=$(python - <<'PY'
from fastvideo.performance.hf_store import sanitize
print(sanitize("<model_id>"))
PY
)
BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/performance_reseed_backup/${TIMESTAMP}_${SHORT_COMMIT}_${MODEL_SAFE}"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
cp -R "${PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT}/${MODEL_SAFE}" "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null || true
```

For v2 records, back up the full local tracking root after sync. Exact identity
lookup scans across model directories, so a benchmark rename may have relevant
history outside the current source artifact's `model_id` directory:

```bash
BACKUP_DIR="/tmp/performance_reseed_backup/${TIMESTAMP}_${SHORT_COMMIT}_v2_exact_identity"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
cp -R "${PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT}" "$BACKUP_DIR/tracking-root"
```

Write provenance next to the backup:

```bash
cat > "$BACKUP_DIR/PROVENANCE.txt" <<EOF
model_id: <model_id>
gpu_type: <gpu_type>
source_results:
  - <source_result_1>
  - <source_result_2>
reseed_record_count: <len(source_results)>
max_intra_batch_regression: <threshold>
head_commit: $(git rev-parse HEAD)
timestamp_utc: $(date -u +%FT%TZ)
reason: <intent_rationale>
EOF
```

If the backup has no prior records, this is not a destructive reseed; it is a
first baseline seed. Continue, but report that baseline history was empty.

### 3. Compute old baseline and candidate shift

Load the last 5 successful baseline records for the target.

For legacy targets:

```python
from fastvideo.performance.hf_store import load_records_for_model

records = load_records_for_model(
    "/tmp/perf-tracking",
    "<model_id>",
    "<gpu_type>",
    last_n=5,
    successful_only=True,
    baseline_eligible_only=True,
)
```

For v2 exact-identity targets:

```python
from fastvideo.performance.hf_store import load_records_for_identity

records = load_records_for_identity(
    "/tmp/perf-tracking",
    {
        "workload_id": "<workload_id>",
        "variant_id": "<variant_id>",
        "benchmark_version": "<benchmark_version>",
        "hardware_profile_id": "<hardware_profile_id>",
        "software_profile_id": "<software_profile_id>",
        "recipe_fingerprint": "<recipe_fingerprint>",
    },
    last_n=5,
    successful_only=True,
    baseline_eligible_only=True,
)
```

Print a small table showing old medians, source batch medians, candidate
medians after appending the proposed seed records, and source batch spread for:

- `latency`
- `throughput`
- `memory`
- `text_encoder_time_s`
- `dit_time_s`
- `vae_decode_time_s`

Also print how many successful old records exist. Make clear:

- 1 seed record usually does not move an existing last-5 median by itself, but
  it is enough to establish the first v2 baseline for a new exact identity.
- 3 consistent seed records usually move the last-5 median immediately.
- 5 consistent seed records effectively reset the last-5 window.
- The records are intentional approved baseline resets and must be labeled
  that way.

### 4. Confirm intent

Require an explicit confirmation phrase before preparing the upload:

> About to RE-SEED performance baseline for `<target description>`.
> This will upload `<N>` new `success=true` records to
> `FastVideo/performance-tracking/<sanitize(model_id)>/` or the source
> artifact's v2 model directory, one per accepted source JSON.
>
> Reason: `<intent_rationale>`
> Source results: `<source_results>`
> Reseed record count: `<N>`
> Max intra-batch regression: `<threshold>`
> Note: these records come from a reviewed source batch and are intended to
> move the rolling median to the accepted runtime profile. They are not
> ordinary main-branch persistence.
> HEAD: `<git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD>`
> Backup: `<BACKUP_DIR>`
>
> Reply `confirm performance reseed` to proceed, anything else to abort.

Do not continue unless the user types exactly `confirm performance reseed`.

### 5. Create the accepted seed records

Create one seed record from each normalized source result.

For first v2 baseline seeds, use the scoped utility. It validates exact
identity, requires successful scheduled-main full-suite `CALIBRATION_NEEDED`
source artifacts, preserves the normalized v2 identity and metadata fields,
and writes seed records with `success=true`, `baseline_eligible=true`, and
`comparison_status=PASS`:

```bash
python fastvideo/tests/performance/seed_baseline.py \
  --source-result <normalized_perf_1.json> \
  --source-result <normalized_perf_2.json> \
  --intent-rationale "<intent_rationale>" \
  --max-intra-batch-regression 0.05 \
  --tracking-root "${PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT}" \
  --staging-root "${PERFORMANCE_RESEED_STAGING_ROOT:-/tmp/performance_reseed_prepared}"
```

The utility is prepare-only and intentionally has no upload option. Upload the
scoped records only after the separate confirmation in step 6.

The utility validates against an isolated fresh HF snapshot and leaves
`PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT` untouched; that argument only proves the staging
root is separate from the operator's tracking mirror. Before writing, it stops
if the exact identity already has a successful baseline-eligible record or if
the workload/variant/version already trusts another recipe. It atomically
reserves the exact identity and writes a digest-protected upload manifest bound
to the current HF endpoint, repository id, and repository type. Keep the
prepared records, manifest, source files, and reservation unchanged until the
operation is uploaded or explicitly cleaned up.

If the prepared seed records look correct, upload only those scoped records in
step 7. Do not rerun the utility with a different source list after approval.

For legacy reseeds or accepted v2 baseline shifts from regression artifacts,
create one seed record from each normalized source result. Do not copy the
source JSON wholesale.

Infer the baseline field allowlist from all existing HF records for the target
after syncing, including both `success=true` and `success=false` records. For
legacy targets the target is `(model_id, gpu_type)`. For v2 baseline-shift
reseeds the target is the exact comparable identity. Use the union of
non-provenance keys present in those target records, preserving only fields
that also exist in the normalized source record or are explicitly set by the
reseed workflow. Always include `model_id`, `timestamp`, `success`,
`baseline_eligible`, and `comparison_status` because the upload path and
baseline loader depend on them. Always set `timestamp` to a fresh reseed
timestamp, `success` to `true`, `baseline_eligible` to `true`, and
`comparison_status` to `PASS`. Do not include unrelated source-only fields
that are absent from existing HF records.

Exclude existing provenance or operator metadata from the inferred baseline
field allowlist. At minimum, exclude keys prefixed with `baseline_reseed` and
any fields known to be local-only audit metadata.

If there are no previous HF records for the target, fall back to this default
baseline field list:

- `model_id`
- `timestamp`
- `commit_sha`
- `gpu_type`
- `latency`
- `throughput`
- `memory`
- `text_encoder_time_s`
- `dit_time_s`
- `vae_decode_time_s`
- `success`
- `baseline_eligible`
- `comparison_status`

For v2 baseline-shift reseeds with no previous HF records for the exact
identity, also preserve:

- `workload_id`
- `variant_id`
- `benchmark_version`
- `recipe_fingerprint`
- `hardware_profile_id`
- `software_profile_id`
- `recipe`
- `hardware_profile`
- `software_profile`
- `software_comparison_profile`

Do not upload extra fields from the source artifact.

Optional provenance fields are allowed and useful:

- `baseline_reseed: true`
- `baseline_reseed_reason`
- `baseline_reseed_source_result`
- `baseline_reseed_source_timestamp`
- `baseline_reseed_source_success`
- `baseline_reseed_batch_size`
- `baseline_reseed_batch_index`
- `baseline_reseed_operator`
- `baseline_reseed_max_intra_batch_regression`

The v2 calibration seed utility writes analogous first-seed provenance:

- `baseline_seed: true`
- `baseline_seed_reason`
- `baseline_seed_source_result`
- `baseline_seed_source_status`
- `baseline_seed_source_timestamp`
- `baseline_seed_source_success`
- `baseline_seed_source_run_source`
- `baseline_seed_source_branch`
- `baseline_seed_source_test_scope`
- `baseline_seed_source_pr_number`
- `baseline_seed_batch_size`
- `baseline_seed_batch_index`
- `baseline_seed_operator`

Use a fresh reseed timestamp for each seed record, not the original source
result timestamp. This is required because
`load_records_for_model(..., last_n=5)` keeps the last records after loading
the model directory; stale filenames/timestamps may not enter the last-5
window and therefore may not move the median. Preserve the original source
timestamp in `baseline_reseed_source_timestamp`.

Use the existing filename convention from `_write_tracking_record()`:
`<sanitize(timestamp)>_<sanitize(commit_sha)>.json` under the sanitized model
directory, but include a deterministic suffix such as `_reseed_01`,
`_reseed_02`, and so on before `.json` so multiple records from the same
batch do not overwrite each other.

If a source record already exists on HF with `success=false`, do not edit it
in place unless the user explicitly asked for an audit-preserving correction.
Prefer uploading new accepted seed records so failed history remains visible.

### 6. Pause before upload

Print:

- Backup directory path under `/tmp`.
- Prepared local record paths under `PERFORMANCE_RESEED_STAGING_ROOT`.
- Prepared upload-manifest path under the identity reservation.
- HF paths that will receive the new records.
- Old rolling medians.
- Source batch medians, source batch spread, reseed count, and candidate
  medians.
- Rationale.

Ask the user to reply exactly `upload`. Anything else aborts and leaves the
prepared records plus backup on disk.

### 7. Upload only the scoped records

For a first v2 calibration seed, use the manifest uploader after the user
replies exactly `upload`:

```bash
python -c 'from fastvideo.tests.performance.seed_baseline import upload_prepared_seed_manifest; print(upload_prepared_seed_manifest("<prepared_manifest>"))'
```

The uploader verifies the source and prepared-record digests, pins and scans
the current HF revision, rechecks exact-identity and recipe-cohort conflicts,
and writes the entire batch in one commit whose `parent_commit` must still be
current. A concurrent Hub update makes the commit fail. Do not retry
automatically: preserve staging, refresh/review remote state, and request a new
explicit `upload` after the conflict is understood. Each record goes to:

```text
FastVideo/performance-tracking/<sanitize(model_id)>/<record_filename>.json
```

Never call `upload_record()` once per first-seed record: that can partially
land the batch and has no compare-and-swap guard.

For a legacy reseed or an accepted v2 baseline shift, the first-seed manifest
validator does not apply because an eligible baseline already exists. Upload
only the individually reviewed records prepared in step 5 with the shared
`upload_record(local_path, record, strict=True)` helper. Stop on the first
failure and report exactly which records reached HF; do not silently rerun or
replicate the remainder.

Never bulk upload the tracking or staging root, and never modify another
model's directory in the same operation.

### 8. Report outcome and offer cleanup

Report:

- Uploaded HF paths.
- Backup directory under `/tmp`.
- Local tracking root, usually `/tmp/perf-tracking`.
- Old baseline window count and medians.
- Source batch medians, source batch spread, reseed count, and candidate
  medians.
- Expected effect based on reseed count.
- Any separate threshold changes still needed in
  `.buildkite/performance-benchmarks/tests/*.json`.

Include the `intent_rationale` in the PR or follow-up comment so reviewers can
distinguish an accepted baseline shift from a hidden regression.

After the upload is verified, ask whether the user wants to clear temporary
local state. Explain what each directory is for:

- `PERFORMANCE_TRACKING_ROOT`, usually `/tmp/perf-tracking`: read-only local
  synced mirror used for operator review and reporting. First-v2 preparation
  independently proves remote state from a fresh temporary HF snapshot.
- `PERFORMANCE_RESEED_STAGING_ROOT`, usually
  `/tmp/performance_reseed_prepared`: prepared local seed records used for the
  scoped upload, plus the identity reservation and digest manifest. Keeping
  this separate prevents aborted preparations from appearing in later
  baseline reads.
- `/tmp/performance_reseed_backup/<...>`: local backup of the target model's
  pre-reseed HF history plus `PROVENANCE.txt`, kept so a bad reseed can be
  audited or corrected.
- `/tmp/performance_reseed_source/<...>` when used: downloaded source JSON
  artifacts from Buildkite URLs.

Ask:

> Reseed succeeded. Do you want me to delete the local temp tracking mirror,
> this reseed's prepared staging records, source downloads, and reseed backup
> under `/tmp`? These files are local safety/audit artifacts only; HF already
> has the uploaded records.
>
> Reply `cleanup reseed temp` to delete them, anything else to keep them.

Do not delete anything unless the user replies exactly
`cleanup reseed temp`. If cleanup is requested, remove only the specific
directories and prepared record paths created for this reseed. Do not remove
the shared staging root when it contains other records. Remove this operation's
identity reservation only with its prepared records and manifest, and never
remove unrelated `/tmp` contents.

## Failure modes and handling

- **`HF_API_KEY` unset.** Stop before upload. Do not create an untracked
  process that appears to have reseeded but never reached HF.
- **Source result does not match target.** Stop. The wrong benchmark or GPU
  would poison a separate baseline.
- **Source batch is internally inconsistent.** Stop if any source regresses
  against the source batch median by more than `max_intra_batch_regression`.
  Ask for cleaner sources or a reviewed explanation before continuing.
- **Too few source records to move the median.** Continue only after making
  clear that one or two records may not immediately move an existing last-5
  median. This warning does not block a first v2 calibration seed for an exact
  identity with no eligible baseline yet.
- **The source results are noisy or suspicious.** Stop. Reseeding amplifies
  those measurements into the baseline, so they must be reviewed first.
- **HF sync fails.** Stop for destructive reseeds. A stale or empty sync can
  make the old baseline look missing.
- **The exact v2 identity already has an eligible baseline.** Stop. The
  `CALIBRATION_NEEDED` artifact is stale; use the reviewed baseline-shift path
  instead of the first-seed utility.
- **The workload/variant/version trusts another recipe.** Stop. The source is
  stale relative to the current recipe cohort and must not bypass
  `RECIPE_MISMATCH` by creating a second trusted recipe.
- **The staging root already has a prepared seed for the exact identity.**
  Stop and reuse, upload, or explicitly clean that preparation. Do not prepare
  another copy of the same measurement.
- **The conditional Hub commit loses its parent race.** Stop without retrying.
  Keep the preparation, refresh and review the new remote state, then request
  a new explicit `upload` only if the seed is still valid.
- **Candidate still violates fixed thresholds.** Report that this skill only
  handles the rolling HF baseline; update benchmark JSON thresholds in code
  review if maintainers accept the new absolute limit.
- **The user aborts at either confirmation.** Leave the backup and prepared
  records on disk. Nothing should be uploaded.
- **The user declines cleanup.** Keep `/tmp/perf-tracking`, the prepared seed
  records under `/tmp/performance_reseed_prepared`, the source download
  directory if any, and `/tmp/performance_reseed_backup/<...>` in place for
  audit/debugging.
- **A bad seed was uploaded.** Use the backup and HF history to identify the
  uploaded file, then remove or supersede it with an explicitly reviewed
  corrective record. Do not silently rewrite unrelated history.
