The reference videos are used as part of e2e SSIM regression tests.
Wan inference coverage now lives in `test_wan_t2v_similarity.py` and
`test_wan_i2v_similarity.py` alongside the other model-specific SSIM files.
These tests compare newly generated videos against references to detect quality
regressions.

reference layout:
- `reference_videos/default/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model>/<backend>/...`
- `reference_videos/full_quality/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model>/<backend>/...`

`A40_reference_videos` are generated on A40s and so on. (legacy default layout
`<ssim_dir>/<GPU>_reference_videos/...` is still read as fallback.)

Before SSIM tests run, missing reference videos are auto-downloaded from a
public HF repo (configured by `FASTVIDEO_SSIM_REFERENCE_HF_REPO`, default:
`FastVideo/ssim-reference-videos`).

Use the CLI:
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py --help`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py copy-local --help`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py copy-local --quality-tier default --device-folder H200_reference_videos`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py copy-local --quality-tier full_quality --device-folder H200_reference_videos`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py download --help`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py upload --help`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py download --quality-tier all`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py upload --quality-tier all`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py download --quality-tier full_quality --device-folder H200_reference_videos`
- `python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py upload --quality-tier full_quality --device-folder H200_reference_videos`

For `upload`, the tool reads HF token from `HF_API_KEY` /
`HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` / `HF_TOKEN` and fails fast if none are set.

run `pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/ -vs --ssim-full-quality` to use the
`*_FULL_QUALITY_PARAMS` configs (default run keeps the original shortened test
configs).

to override the HF reference repo at test time:
`pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/ -vs --ssim-reference-repo <org/repo>`

to skip auto-download of missing refs:
`pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/ -vs --skip-ssim-reference-download`

to bootstrap draft refs for a new model:
`pytest fastvideo/tests/ssim/ -vs --ssim-bootstrap-mode`

generated videos are written under:
- default params: `generated_videos/default/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model_id>/<ATTENTION_BACKEND>/`
- full-quality params: `generated_videos/full_quality/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model_id>/<ATTENTION_BACKEND>/`

HF repo layout mirrors quality + GPU split:
- `reference_videos/default/<GPU>_reference_videos/...`
- `reference_videos/full_quality/<GPU>_reference_videos/...`

Draft bootstrap refs are uploaded under:
- `drafts/default/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model_id>/<ATTENTION_BACKEND>/...`
- `drafts/full_quality/<GPU>_reference_videos/<model_id>/<ATTENTION_BACKEND>/...`

reference videos were generated on commit `4aeabbc629e0edf91477e80e795e7bb1823c71cb`
causal videos were generated on commit b318063c0a4618f1d5d99ea82ca67a06aad0d19d

## Adding a New SSIM Test

SSIM CI runs in one four-GPU Slinky Slurm lease. The orchestrator
(`fastvideo/tests/ssim/ci_runner.py`) runs after the shared worker has cloned,
built, and installed the exact PR SHA, then schedules multiple `pytest`
subprocesses by GPU demand. Logs are printed in deterministic order for failed
tasks (file name, then model id), and fail-fast is enabled: if one task fails,
active tasks are terminated and the full SSIM step fails.

Change-aware merge gates can pass repeated `--test-file <basename>` arguments,
so a model-family PR runs only its owning SSIM files. Shared scheduler/helper
changes, `/test ssim`, `/test full`, and the weekly `main` schedule run the
complete discovered matrix.

The orchestrator auto-discovers every `test_*.py` file here, so no CI config
changes are needed when adding a new test. To declare how many GPUs your test
requires, add a module-level constant near the top of the file:

```python
REQUIRED_GPUS = 2
```

If `REQUIRED_GPUS` is omitted, the test defaults to 1 GPU.

For files that define model maps (`*_MODEL_TO_PARAMS`), CI splits execution
into one subprocess per model id by setting `FASTVIDEO_SSIM_MODEL_ID`.

## Bootstrapping New References

Normal SSIM runs are strict: missing references fail the test. For a new model
PR, add `[new-model]` to the PR title or set `FASTVIDEO_SSIM_BOOTSTRAP_MODE=1`
for the Buildkite job. CI then passes `--ssim-bootstrap-mode` to pytest.

In bootstrap mode, a missing pixel `.mp4` or latent `.pt` reference is treated
as an expected draft-reference case after the generated artifact has been
written. The test uploads that generated artifact to the HF reference repo under
`drafts/...` and marks the case `xfail`. Bootstrap mode does not weaken normal
CI because it is opt-in only.

After reviewing a draft, promote it into the canonical reference layout:

```bash
python fastvideo/tests/ssim/reference_videos_cli.py promote-draft \
  --quality-tier default \
  --device-folder L40S_reference_videos \
  --model-id <model_id>
```

Use `--attention-backend <backend>` to promote one backend folder. Promotion
refuses to overwrite existing canonical refs by default; pass `--force` only
when intentionally replacing reviewed references.

## Generation Details

SSIM CI schedules work across the four GPUs leased by
`.buildkite/scripts/lanes/ssim.sh` using
`fastvideo/tests/ssim/ci_runner.py`.

### Text-to-Video Prompts

1. "Will Smith casually eats noodles, his relaxed demeanor contrasting with the energetic background of a bustling street food market. The scene captures a mix of humor and authenticity. Mid-shot framing, vibrant lighting."

2. "A lone hiker stands atop a towering cliff, silhouetted against the vast horizon. The rugged landscape stretches endlessly beneath, its earthy tones blending into the soft blues of the sky. The scene captures the spirit of exploration and human resilience. High angle, dynamic framing, with soft natural lighting emphasizing the grandeur of nature."

### Image-to-Video Prompts

1. "An astronaut hatching from an egg, on the surface of the moon, the darkness and depth of space realised in the background. High quality, ultrarealistic detail and breath-taking movie-like camera shot."
