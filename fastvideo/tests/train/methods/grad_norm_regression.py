"""Layer-0 grad-norm regression for the per-method training smoke tests.

Phase 2 / 5a-ii: layers a device-keyed grad-norm check on top of the
finite/non-zero grad assertions established in 5a-i. After one
``single_train_step`` + ``backward``, the L2 norm of transformer block 0's
trainable gradients is compared against a reference value pinned per GPU in
``grad_norm_refs.json`` (next to this module).

Determinism: the harness seeds both the global RNG and the method's
``cuda_generator`` via ``method.on_train_start()`` (``training.data.seed`` in the
fixture), and the synthetic ``raw_batch`` is built *after* that call, so the
forward/backward is reproducible within bf16 reduction noise on a given GPU.

Why device-keyed: grad norms differ across GPU architectures (kernels,
accumulation order), so a single golden value can't cover every runner. The
JSON carries legacy ``L40S`` references and active Slinky CI ``GB200``
references (``B200`` maps to the same Blackwell key).

Seeding a reference for the current device:

- **CI / GB200** — run the target train-framework lane on the Slinky Slurm
  runner with update mode only during an intentional reviewed reseed, then
  copy the recorded value from the log into ``grad_norm_refs.json``.
- **Local / other GPUs** — on that workstation::

      FASTVIDEO_GRADNORM_UPDATE=1 \\
          pytest fastvideo/tests/train/methods -vs -rs

  The harness writes the measured norm into ``grad_norm_refs.json`` under the
  device's key and skips the assertion for that run. Append a new substring
  entry to ``_DEVICE_MAPPINGS`` first for any device not already listed.
