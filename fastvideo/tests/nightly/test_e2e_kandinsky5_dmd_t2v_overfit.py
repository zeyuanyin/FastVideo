"""Single-sample overfit / small end-to-end run for Kandinsky5 QAD:
stage-1 Attn-QAT finetune -> stage-2 QAT-aware DMD distillation, on the
new ``fastvideo/train/`` stack -- validated all the way to the public
inference artifact this recipe exists to produce.

Unlike ``test_e2e_dmd_t2v_crush_smol.py`` (which drives the legacy
``fastvideo/training/wan_distillation_pipeline.py`` CLI), this drives the
new-stack entrypoint (``fastvideo.train.entrypoint.train``) via the same
YAML configs used for real training
(``examples/train/configs/fine_tuning/kandinsky5/t2v_480p_qat.yaml`` and
``examples/train/configs/distribution_matching/kandinsky5/dmd2_t2v_480p_qat.yaml``),
with a handful of steps and dotted-key overrides pointing at a tiny local
dataset -- mirroring how a real run would be launched, just shrunk down.

The full validated chain, each arrow a hard assertion:

  synthetic clip -> preprocess -> stage-1 train -> stage-1 DCP
    -> dcp_to_diffusers --verify (strict reload)
    -> stage-2 train (student/teacher/critic init_from that export)
    -> stage-2 student DCP -> dcp_to_diffusers --verify (strict reload)
    -> VideoGenerator.from_pretrained(export,
           override_pipeline_cls_name="Kandinsky5DMDPipeline",
           pipeline_config=Kandinsky5DMDConfig())   # the documented recipe
    -> deterministic (fixed-seed) 4-step generation
    -> degeneracy checks + MS-SSIM against the committed reference video.

Every artifact (raw clip, parquet, both stage output dirs, both diffusers
exports, generated video dir) lives under the single test-owned
``data/kandinsky5_e2e/`` root, which is deleted up front -- the
documented user dataset paths (``data/kandinsky5_overfit{,_preprocessed}``)
are never read, written, or removed. ``training.checkpoint.
resume_from_checkpoint`` is explicitly disabled for both stages: the
stage-1 YAML defaults to ``resume_from_checkpoint: latest``, so a rerun
over a dirty ``data/`` dir could otherwise no-op from an old checkpoint
and go green on stale artifacts.

Reference bootstrap: the committed reference
(``reference_video_kandinsky5_dmd_v0.mp4`` next to this file) is produced
by running this test once on a sanctioned GPU box with
``KANDINSKY5_E2E_WRITE_REFERENCE=1``, reviewing the written video by eye,
and committing it. Review bar: expect blurry-but-structured content
loosely matching the prompt (4-step no-CFG sampling of near-base weights
cannot look good) -- soft shapes, warm sunflower-ish colors, motion.
Uniform grey static, solid black, or hard garbage blocks mean a broken
pipeline: do NOT commit such a reference (probe the export with the plain
50-step ``Kandinsky5T2VPipeline`` to isolate weights-path vs sampler
problems). Until a reference exists the test FAILS (it does not skip) --
an artifact-existence-only pass is exactly the false-green this oracle
exists to prevent. Run it with::

    pytest fastvideo/tests/nightly/test_e2e_kandinsky5_dmd_t2v_overfit.py -vs

The single training sample is a synthesized noise clip (not a downloaded
dataset): the exact directory/manifest layout of external raw-video HF
datasets (e.g. the ``crush-smol`` one Wan's e2e test uses) isn't something
this change can verify without a runnable environment, so depending on it
here would risk a silently-wrong assumption. ``preprocess_kandinsky5_overfit.py``
only needs a ``videos2caption.json`` + ``videos/*.mp4`` pair, both of which
this test fully controls.
