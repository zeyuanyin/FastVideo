"""Score-regression tests against reference values from each metric's upstream repo.

Each reference JSON under ``reference_scores/`` was produced by running
the canonical upstream implementation against the asset video under
``asset/`` (provenance recorded in each JSON). This test asserts that
FastVideo's in-process eval, driven through the top-level
``samples_from`` + ``Evaluator.evaluate`` API, lands within tolerance.

    VideoScore2 is a bf16 VLM judge: its three sub-scores are argmaxed
    integers in 1-5, and they can shift by ±1 across GPU architectures /
    transformers versions (the gold is generated on a different GPU than CI
    runs on). A single ±1 flip moves the combined soft mean by ~0.33, so the
    aggregate score is too brittle to regress directly. The integer hard
    scores are far more portable; assert each is within 1 of the reference,
