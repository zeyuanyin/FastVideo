"""The part of a LoRA adapter that is not a low-rank product.

A LoRA states a weight delta as ``B @ A``. That form needs two things to be true: the
base checkpoint must already contain the parameter, and the delta must actually be low
rank. Distilled video checkpoints break both often enough that dropping whatever does
not fit silently loses real signal.

Two payload kinds cover the gap, named after the convention ComfyUI's loader already
reads so one file works in both places:

``<module>.diff`` / ``<module>.diff_b``
    An exact additive delta for a parameter the base model has. Used where a rank-``r``
    factorization buys nothing or cannot be formed at all -- RMSNorm vectors, biases,
    and matrices whose smaller dimension is already at or below the rank that would be
    chosen. Factoring a length-``n`` vector into rank ``r`` costs ``r(1 + n) > n``.

``<module>.set_weight``
    A whole parameter the base model does not carry, so no delta is expressible. MiniMax
    H3's VSA ``to_gate_compress`` is the case that motivated this: it exists only under
    the sparse-attention backend, and :func:`load_model_from_full_model_state_dict`
    otherwise zero-initializes it, which is exactly the "gate contributes nothing"
    state a VSA-distilled student was trained away from.

Both kinds are applied to the *unsharded* tensor while the checkpoint is streaming in,
so FSDP and tensor-parallel placement come from the surrounding loader instead of being
reimplemented here. That ordering is not a preference: ``maybe_load_fsdp_model`` shards
the model on the meta device before any weight is read, so there is no earlier window,
and patching afterwards would mean gathering and redistributing every affected
parameter one at a time.

Because the adapter has to be known when the transformer loads, this path applies the
adapter a pipeline is constructed with. Swapping to a different adapter later still goes
through :meth:`LoRAPipeline.set_lora_adapter`, which handles the low-rank half only.
