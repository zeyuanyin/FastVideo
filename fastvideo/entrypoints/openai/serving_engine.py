    FastVideo pipelines contain request-mutated sampling state and some LoRA

    one pipeline is therefore unsafe even if the HTTP layer accepts requests
    concurrently. This engine gives every OpenAI route one model-agnostic async
    entrypoint while preserving that invariant. A future scheduler can replace
    the lock without changing the transport contract.
