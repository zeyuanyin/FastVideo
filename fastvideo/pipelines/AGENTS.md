# `fastvideo/pipelines/` — Pipeline Composition

**Generated:** 2026-09-14

Diffusion pipelines are **compositions of `PipelineStage` objects**. Each stage owns one verb (validate / encode / schedule / denoise / decode). Adding a model means assembling stages, not subclassing a megapipeline.

## Stage Authoring Rules

- Subclass `PipelineStage` from `stages/base.py`. Implement `forward(batch, args) -> ForwardBatch`.
- Implement `verify_input` / `verify_output` — both return `VerificationResult`. Failures raise `StageVerificationError`.
- Mutate `ForwardBatch` only by reassigning fields you declared in `pipeline_batch_info.py`. New keys → add to the dataclass first.
- Stages must be **deterministic given the same `ForwardBatch + FastVideoArgs`**. Side effects (logging, profiling) only.
- Read all knobs from the passed-in `FastVideoArgs` / `PipelineConfig`. Never `os.getenv` directly.

## Per-Model Pipeline Pattern (`basic/<model>/`)

Every model directory has the same skeleton:

```
basic/<model>/
├── __init__.py
├── <model>_pipeline.py      # Composes stages list
├── presets.py               # Default PipelineConfig + SamplingParam combos
└── (optional) stage_overrides.py, continuation.py, ...
```

`presets.py` is the entry point that `registry.py` imports — it must export the named preset constants used elsewhere in the codebase.

## Forking vs Reusing a Stage

Reuse `stages/text_encoding.py` if your model takes text → embeddings via a standard encoder. Fork only when:

- The model needs a **different ForwardBatch shape** (extra inputs, different output keys).
- The denoising loop has structural differences (causal, refine-then-denoise, multi-stream).

When forking, keep the file name model-prefixed (`longcat_*`, `gamecraft_*`) so the registry stays grep-able.

Wan's family-specific stages live in `basic/wan/stages/`; see
`basic/wan/AGENTS.md`. Shared dense scheduling/CFG stays in `stages/denoising.py`.
Do not put Wan expert selection, first-frame VAE execution, or DMD/causal
sampling recipes back into that shared loop. Legacy sampler imports remain
lazy aliases to avoid family/shared import cycles.

## Per-Package `AGENTS.md` and `JOURNAL.md` (optional)

Pipelines with non-trivial parity invariants, lazy-loaded shared components,
or cross-component coordination MAY ship a per-package `AGENTS.md` and
`JOURNAL.md` next to the pipeline files. The canonical example is
`basic/magi_human/AGENTS.md` (umbrella HF repo, four lazy-loaded shared
components, channel-major packing + dtype-boundary invariants).

When present:

- `basic/<model>/AGENTS.md` — manifest table of every file in scope, parity
  invariants, "if you change X re-run Y" cross-refs, run book, open
  questions, provenance (PR numbers + source SHAs).
- `basic/<model>/JOURNAL.md` — port-state log for the original port; useful
  for future maintainers to understand why specific decisions were made.

These files are **not** required for simple ports that share stages and have
no special parity invariants.

## Anti-Patterns

- Putting a full pipeline in a single file under `basic/<model>/` instead of composing stages.
- Reading config from globals or env vars inside a stage.
- Adding cross-stage state via module-level dicts. Use `ForwardBatch`.
